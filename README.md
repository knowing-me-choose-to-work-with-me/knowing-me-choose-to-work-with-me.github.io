- some other title that i thought of 
    - knowing-me-hire-me, hire-me-fire-me-once-job-is-done, knowing me-knowing-you([abba-song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowing_Me,_Knowing_You))

## Motivation for this site, from a perspective of  hiring-me or choosing-to-work-with-me
Its difficult to put all our thoughts in condensed 2 page resume, this is  more of a open book to my experiences.
Also, in my experiences, so far, while working to solve a core business problem, friction is unavoidable, ocassionaly demands lot more time and energy, we usually have have lot of differences in opinions, culuture, thoughts, methodologies, approaches, problem-solving-skills, real-time-experiences, the way we perceive real-world and software-world etc.
This open book of my mine  should help minimize friction towards me, you and us, make us more comfortable, familiar in our ideas, thoughts and creativity. Hopefully,  this site helps you understand me better on my rationale choices and  you welcome me with a open mindset


## about me | prashanth.jtr@gmail.com | linkedin.com/in/prashanth-tr-ba3363304
- Prashanth T R, myself a  Software Engineer having 18years of experience in IT with research-first mindset, building and automating for data-centric novel-business-problems
    - all business problems are unique and they need a customized solution built for its purpose, constrant-space
    - the research is not to burn the cash of the company but to find low-cost-effective technology solution, they typically involve few weeks, parallely while trying to understand the business we are suppose to automate
    - by automation, I mean as  simple as arithmetic to algebraic to advanced ones(regression,interpoloation,xyz)  to a  scale (multiplied by domain like nubmer of products, customers, time etc) because deep down thats what I have encountered so far.
    - by data centric I usually mean the volume of equations to be automated say like thousands to millions to billions with some busniess-rules which are specific to the domain context of the problem
- You want just one reason to figure out if i will be fit or not to the team, problem
    - Given enough autonomy on solving the problem, I typically form a small team(3 to 4 people) apply a feature-driven-development splitting with a mental-model of organic business-flows (say 1 to 10 or so), showing/demonstrating business with new capabilities(automation), carefully crafting for core-important-flows say (4 to 6) identified with verifiable weightage (60 to 80)% giving business stakeholder with  few design-options which they can choose based on cost-factors like development(scoped-to-time), competence, financial and opportunity with cost-effective technology solutions. 
        - I have proven track record of $23/tb on storing and leveraging this further to processing with just 1-network-call
        - I do have solid grip on doing in-memory processing  with either mutations or immutable techniques for larger data-sets in millions in pratice and  in theory it holds good for billions as well.
        - as an engineer, if you are excited on leveraging cloud-object-stores full potential for historical data usecases , then my expertize, may be worth while to consider.
        - I also have great interest in using serverless FAAS technologies
        - [math-works](#math-works)
- I'm also open for contract to hire for 6 months, with some negotiations on my billing.
- If you are looking for an IC role, please check on relevant sections.
- Future-thoughts
    - I do have a thought of being an independent-consultant or agency of few-like minded people, though its down the road of 3 to 5 years

## math-works
- lets check how much records we can process with limited ram of 8gb
- step-1: assuming 1kb record with unique columnar data(20 to 30 columns) 
- step-2: we have a scale of 1000 records, this implies roughly 1MB
- step-3: we have 1000 * 1000 records = 1million records 1gb
- step-4: we have a compute with 8gb ram = 8 million records with 8gb :: this couldbe in raspberry pi 4/5 with 8gb ram
- step-5: scaling vertically we could go higher to 16gb(16 million records) or 32gb (32 million records)
- step-6: as we now see RAMs getting costlier we can think of scaling horizontaly and distribute the load say stateles-http request with 2 or 3 machines(roughly 100 million records) in theory roughly we could also process it in 12 raspberry pi 4/5 with 8gb rams
- note in step 2, 3 I took a worst case scenario in normal business scenarios this not the case and with encoding and compression even in 8gb ram we could literally store 10x of step-4 say 80 to 100 million.
- on a side note we could also eliminate some unwanted columns which dont make sense, if are doing an aggregation logic
- in java i have a good grip on hashing(immutable-structures like string, numbers), leveraging further on business-domain-attributes,  and complementing above with hashing becomes powerful enough to do in O(1) search,insertions
- Next we could leverage the multicores, ghz of cpu to process faster if we need to 
- above is checklist or litmus test when i hear huge data in brainstorming
- usually the business equations are stright-forward automations of arithmetic, algebraic equations, unless we move towards analytics, data-science, ML

## Cultural Fitness
- Each org has unique culture, each individual might view it differently, You could have your own perception of your organization,company
- Below is mine
- primarily result, outcome oriented, open minded
-  social  at (face2face,phone,sms) not at whatsapp,telegram etc to avoid-news-gossips
- in my view god is binary, i choose 0, but like to go for archiecture,hill-view, on religous places, monuments
    - please dont screen me - if you have a  strong ideology or weightage on any particular religion,geography,language
    - on as side not i watch movies in 
- food (coffe,tea, seafood,traditional,authentic indian cusine) generally have very low perferces for star rated food, especially coporate-ones
- for lesiure prefer  progressive-music, movies(sci-fic,non-fic(true-story-inspire, biographical))
    - i do watch movies in many languages(english,hindi,kannada,tamil,malayalam,telgu,korean etc)
- love to  travel(mountains, jungles, beaches, historical-monuments for architecture)
- love to shop in decathlon for everything I need including office, bike, hiking wearables.
- i dont understand politics and dont like to be involved in office polictics as well  , though i am not too blind at voting
- I am quite selective in my work, once picked I do commit till its completed.
- I do like sharing knowledge, teaching, selective mentoring etc
- i prefer challenging work where in can improvise on the solutions, mostly for novel-business-problems
- [My Work Style](#my-work-style) - this might also be interesting.

## Teaching Mentoring
- In my [Company-1-Tomax Jun-2005 to Sep-2009](#company-1-tomax-jun-2005-to-sep-2009) after we got trained for 6 months, company tasked us to mentor the next 2 batches (3 to 4 people)  for subsequent years, they were amazing with lot of energy, curiosity and  we also got better by teaching them based. We had to keep upto date with technology-trends like J2EE at that time. It also improvised my vocabulary
- In [Company-2-CSC Dec-2009 to Mar-201](#company-2-csc-dec-2009-to-mar-2016) at the client manager(verizon) after gaining 1.5 years of trust and relationship, was open enough in tasking us (csc-colleagues) to mentor their 1st batch of fresh college engineers whom they had hired probably for  diversity. We shared a lot, laughed a lot, it was fun with them. 1 person had keen interest in solving with performance and my luck also he got assigned to my team. He always challenged the solutions which we were baking, it was good exercise for me as I mentored him.
  on my next assigment with client Societe Generalle, I mentored to certain extent on experienced like 5+ years
  - In [Company-3-Wipro Apr-2016 Jul-2018](#company-3-wipro-apr-2016-jul-2018), I met a young developer 2+ years or so whom I taught few things on technical and he taught me several things on business-domain, he was the goto person if I had any doubts in business the way it worked
  - In [Company-4-GE Oct-2018 Jan-2024](#company-4-ge-oct-2018-jan-2024) perhaps this is the one where in I have mentored a lot ranging from 2+ to 8+
    - on my 1st assignment, as I was disovering myself on several things,  closely taught and shared almost everything I learnt from conferences like GIDS, to  3 to 4 GE-engineers , 1-vendor-partner because of their curiosity, open-minded culture
    - on my second assigment, though I shared all nosql learning with larger vendor-centric-team, accidentally I trained 1 vendor-partner on lot of hashing and low-level techniques assuming him to be 3 to 4 years. It was after a month or so that I realized that he had only 5 to 6 months of experencice. He was damn good at figuring out a low-level shall-cloning bug which I was struggling to figure out

## Autonomy-on-problem-solving over designation,Position,money
- If you have top 3 problems and you care about outcome,result than routine process below might help
    - autonomy to form a small team of my own would be a great help 
    - In my view and experience  team with good matching frequency and autonomy(tools,techniques,time-mgmt) does a lot more than expected and as lead or team-member I ensure or contribute to the best of my knowledge
- normally in big organizations, the buhorizontal-ride
- vertical-ride

## Recuriter HR

- you probably want to take a look at culture-fitness first
- Also it would be really helpful and saving time for both of us if hiring panel gets to know me with my resume, site 
- I am primarily looking for role which demands solution-architecture, scalable-system-design, software-architecture, data-modeling
- I am not much conerned about designation, as along as the role promises above or something equivalent
- I am not a cloud architect, I usually leverage cloud technologies
- I am open for remote, hybrid(2 to 3 days)

## CXO
- I will consider lucky if I you are looking at my profile
- leaving other Xs, assuming you are CTO, CDO, CIO
- i have only few things to sell you to the best of my current knowledge
- i can store data as cheap as $23 per tb leveraging aws-s3 or eqvt store
- I could think of process and come with a serveless model with 10gb (10 to 80 million records) with stipulated time of 15min window
- I could help in a scalable-model leveraging partitioning on data with core-domain attributes like product, customer and go further down with sub-domain and crafting with custom-tailored-solution
- Could also help in vertical-wide, evolvable-architecture with good design-options 
- you need to form a team internal, external to solve the problem with out-of-the-box thinking for a novel-business-problem

## Architect | solution-architect
- You can expect below from me.
    - my strength is really on applying domain-driven-design, doing trade-off analysis, documenting architectural decisions, design options for novel-business-problems
    - In my view buisness-flow, data-flow diagrams are more important than general clould providers reference architecture. 
    - i generally put the busines-domain-langugae to be centric and ubiquitious, so runtime infra is low preference.
    - I usually draw plain diagrams  which caters larger-stakeholders like (PO, FO, BA,developers) so that we all speak same language and simplify the problem in first-hand. Next explore some new busines-capabilities.
    - i strongly believe core functionality to work smoother, accurate on aggregations, so its important we are clear with core problem.
    - once we are thorough, of course we can  now look a scalability leveraging domain-attributes. 
    - I usually believ in crafting custom-tailored-solution constrained to the actual-problem-space
    - I love taking to all stakeholder from developer to all way from business-stakeholders, I do respect all. 
    - I generally present 2 or 3 design option allow stakeholders to choose interms of cost-constraints like money, developemnt, opportunity etc
    - this might be furter helpful

        - [Why do I step into your shoes](#why-do-i-step-into-your-shoes)
- I am usually bad at below.
    - I dont 
    - I usually dont have a generic-architecture that I could readily apply, unless the domain-problem is very static in nature.
    - Please excuse me, if I dont have a general cloud-providers infra reference architecture diagram.
    - Also, I am not really good at CICD pipelines, I usually try some  alternatives till the feature shapes up well, I usually automate this at end,
    - Though, I have some interest in SRE and operational stuff, until business problem demands it, I stay away from over-engineering on SRE the business-attributes show exhibit this behavior
    - if applications are not-internet facing,  I usually  dont emphasize too much metics like junit, sonar, sast,cast, monitoring(new-relic) tool as they often dont get the context of problem, mostly they have false positives, though configuring them is no harm and potentially serve as a checklist.



## Why do I step into your shoes
- I attempt to know the problem from  your point of view
- some rationale of my  biggest fears you need to know
    - if i/we have misunderstood requirement as whole
    - if there were will be change in requirement which need to be factored
    - do we have wholistic view of problem
    - what are the unknowns i/we need to know
    - if the current tool/technology/solution is optimal enough, cheap enough etc
    - will it bring change in the software design
    - u  are not telling me that new  customer to be added, not sure how long will it take to incorporate
    - not sure if the current tool/applicaiton/feature will be retired/replatformed with new one
-  occasionaly it might appear as if im stepping into your shoes/role, it could be becuase of myrole(could be informal) on an ideology of https://architectelevator.com/ my assignment is usually very short one 6 months. some one has to ride the elevator connecting all stakeholders as gregor mentions, nothing is stopping us to rotate by 90 and imagine left to rides as tram/cable-car which goes from left-to-right or vice versa. this horizontal/cascade ride is very true when we talk on lot of upstream or downstream connected systems/applications



## Product Owner
        - based on my own experience, POs as oppososed to have total ownership(domain,technical,operational-stuff),  play a mix of roles (mgmt,point-of-contact, delegator-to-(technical-team, QA, BA etc) ) 
        - my last company had only 13 product lines, but hundres of POs, so thats where my difference of opinion comes from.
        - if you could help me on what you would like to own and your expectations from my side we could have less friction and put our business goal than occasional-namesake-roles
        - below is how I could help, clarify
        - Fact : mostly I have solved several problems in last 10+ years of 18 year IT career not because of technical(breadth + depth) but puerly undestanding functional-domain-knowledge(mostly breadth, ecosystem, business-flow,data-flow etc )  becuase  I leverage on [domain-driven-design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) 
        - optimisitically in my opinion I think a domain-expert-panel(PO,funcitionalowner,BA) should screen the 1st or 2nd round of interview-if-external, if interal-assignment(alteast do a litmus test, unless PO is playing a pure-people-leader-mgmt or forced to do so). atleast you could devise the system problem in a ciphered manner and see if the candiate/new-member(someone like me ) could solve the actual problem, worst-case atleast you get a fair idea on solution cost(development,opportunity,money($,inr,euro )
        - ok we have no choice but to work together, here is further, how we can help each other
        - whats the core features of the app/system
        - what are the top 3 bizness problems you think we should solve for next 6 months or for a year.
        - is there any feature in your mind which you think it of greater value that top 3, but you didnt get anyone help from technical-feasability side.
        - rather than adding features, you think stabilization is of prime importance.
        - no matter what we pick we will together agree and tradeoff something.

        - please dont hestiate give feedback, once in a month or so, becuse typically i take projects for 6 months or so.
        -  occasionaly it might appear as if im stepping into your shoes/role, it could be becuase of myrole(could be informal) on an ideology of https://architectelevator.com/ my assignment is usually very short one 6 months
        - [Why do I step into your shoes](#why-do-i-step-into-your-shoes)
        
## Functional Owner
- not every company has it, but when they have, probably its best consider below
- breadth of functional-domain
- end-user, customers pain-points, re-negotiate on demo-feedback, development-cost
- occasionaly discuss on new buiness capabilities (any one  could also do, but I feet this person is best negoitator along with PO )
- not all features, enhancement are worth, after careful data-points,impact of (1end user vs larger-audience) so push-back with you could help us.
- if you are new like me please involve me in stakeholder discussion, or give me a summmary so that I could help better later
- irrespeciive of my designation, you could treat me as a problem-solver who like brainstorming for new ideas or studid ideas
- any feedback anytime is welcome, please check on my assigment-duration with my reporting mgr, so that u could plan a important delivery.

## Business Analyst
- here's 
- if there's one role i have benefitted in solving many hard problems is on clarity Business Analysts /FOs
- if you know sql, you could pull out the data from database, that's excellent for us to further simplify the requirement
- if you dont have sql knowledge, no problem, we could pull out the data into excel or any spreadsheet which you are comfortable, we could simplify from there, 
- typically we could be undestanding bread and depth of dataflow,
    - if analytics then do aggregation, rollup strategy  on either production-or-near equivalent data proabably masked with cutomer data
    - if data not available, we could brainstorm on the core domain attributes, and ourself project a data volume growth, and validate our few theories
- oh, you have an excellent idea which is benefetial to business ,but so far nobody entertained from technical-team, yes we could discuss, if my role allows i will try to ride up that idea to upper stakeholders to bottom developers
- [Why do I step into your shoes](#why-do-i-step-into-your-shoes) 

## Backend Developer/Engineer
- hmm irrespective of my designation, i always love coding, designing, evaluating tradeoffs
- I am one of you on git.
- first thing I like is working people smarter than me, so I could be very dumb(domain, familarity)  as your are expert in  the current project, so please expect lot of stupid questions and bare me for few weeks, till I get a good grip on understanding the problem-domain, feature, rationale for current design & tech-stack etc 
- if you are new like me, we are in same boat, we will sail together unless there is a big hole(wrong domain, wrong technology) to sink
- it would be great if could know your availablity, tech-stack, functional-domain-knowledge etc
- Togther we will be heavily collaborating on  git, confluence, though i usually prefer java,sql for complex problems, as long as business requirement is met  with 90% of inteded business-use-cases ask BUC, you could pick your own languge, design, deployment tool
- mostly I dont do  peer code-review, due to lack of  grip on the business-domain, sometime its too obvious.
- please try to summarize the domain,context for which the code change was made, so that we can together see if this code change, breaks any business-flow, data-flow etc.
- however if you request me because for some rationale like you could break the existing business flow, you dont understand the domain, you encountered heavy bugs offlate and you broke somthing u need another pair of eyes. based on the complexity we will set aside some dedicated time and will together approach.
-  if its a scalbility-problem, data-intensive-compuation, major-security-concern I would do a peer review
-  in my view, business-purpose for what we changed the code is most critical thing, so lets document either in code itself, confluence etc
- most importantly we will come up with multiple design-options with cost(development,tradeoffs,timelines, buffer) together we will give present it back and ask decision-maker-of-buisness to choose and we execute according to the plan
    - remember we will try figure out a least-worst-design as opposed to best-design(becuase it keeps changig every year)
    - if there is not much change in business, we dont need heavy design either whatever 1st desing works could be deployed asap, thats the best we could do
    - we could be refactoring (applying martin-flowers techniques) on critical-domain-areas
- just 1 thing if you are too much excited about a technology, we will first try on least-impacted business-domain, test it for few months and then apply slowly in critical-areas.
        - 
## Frontend Developer/Engineer
    - Though,I dont have, much grip on frontend technologies, I do care for responsiveness like SLA of overall Page in 2 to 5 seconds, though this varies from domain to domain, will see what I can help, 
    - from backend anything like a dynamic 2d api with headers and attributes is totaly feasible solution to reduce your all developemnt activities
    - generally, I look at reducing number of clicks, elminating some user entry inputs from small controls to whole screen if it makes sense to automate
    - its also worth to know that, we could reduce the network-rountrips, overall input exchange between front-end and backend and together we can stratgize this, historically, we have solved in past by using database and service layer to to the best of knowledge.
    - on a side note we will try to make the layout as adaptive as possible than absloute positioning
