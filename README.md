## Bit On Title
- Some other titles that i had thought of 
    - knowing-me-support-me, knowing-me-hire-me, hire-me-fire-me-once-job-is-done, 6-months-consultant, 
    - probably you could try listening to this song while you analyze my thoughts [Knowing Me, Knowing You](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowing_Me,_Knowing_You))


## Site Motivation
- Motivation for this site, is to help you decide in  hiring-me or helping in your decision making so that you/your team could make a better choice to work with me.
- On one dimension, it's difficult to put all our thoughts in condensed 2 page resume, this is  more of a open book to my experiences so that you can make better choices as you are evaluating me for certain role
- In another dimension, In my all experiences, so far, while working to solve a core-business-problem, as we try to discover each other, friction is unavoidable and  mostly demands lot more time, energy and patience to understand each other. 
    - this could be primarily because of few factors and dimensions, we usually have have lot of differences in opinions, culuture, thoughts, methodologies, techniques, approaches, problem-solving-skills, real-time-experiences, the way we perceive real-world and software-world etc
- This is an open book of my mine, to  help you minimize friction towards me, yourself and us as a team and eventually to make us more comfortable, familiar in our ideas, thoughts and creativity. Hopefully,  this site helps you understand me better on my rationale choices and help you hire/welcome me with an open mindset
- Its my attempt to automate my intro, thoughts, my rational biases etc 
- what its not
    - Not to show off on my website skills with html/js stuff, its 99% static + 1% dynamic(clickable)
- if not for work, just for a coffee talk, just drop me a mail, on topic you would like to connect
- Last, but not the least, it's influenced by wiki links, so please feel to click whatever interests you
- rest assured this is not a generated AI content, grammatical/typo errors  of mine should convince on that.
    - if you find any disastorous grammatical context, please excuse me, hopefully and eventually they will be corrected.

## About Me 
- Prashanth T R, myself a  Software Engineer having 18years of experience in IT with research-first mindset, building and automating for data-centric novel-business-problems
    - all business problems are unique and they need a customized solution built for its purpose, constrant-space
    - the research is not to burn the cash of the company but to find low-cost-effective technology solution, 
        - complex business domain take time to get clear understanding. we get better undestanding to choose right cost-effective techniques, tools as we make repeated attempts.
    - by automation, I mean as  simple as arithmetic to algebraic to advanced ones(regression,interpoloation,xyz)  to a  scale (multiplied by domain like nubmer of products, customers, time etc) because deep down thats what I have encountered so far.
    - by data centric I usually mean the volume of equations to be automated say like thousands to millions to billions with some busniess-rules which are specific to the domain context of the problem
## One Reason To Work With Me
- You want just one reason to figure out if i will be a good fit or not for your team, for your current set of problems
    - Given enough autonomy on solving the business-problem, I typically form a small team(3 to 4 people) apply a feature-driven-development splitting with a mental-model of organic business-flows (say 1 to 10 or so), showing/demonstrating business with new capabilities(automation), carefully crafting for core-important-flows say (4 to 6) identified with verifiable weightage (60 to 80)% giving business stakeholder with  few design-options which they can choose based on cost-factors like development(scoped-to-time), competence, financial and opportunity with cost-effective technology solutions. 
        - I typically take few rides vertical to horizontal to make sure end-users  domain-problem is well understood, is put at the center of the solution, the overall solution-space surronds it. 
            - [Software Design by domain-driven-design](#software-design-by-domain-driven-design) broken-link
        - I have proven track record of building-cost-centric solutions with $23/tb on custom-techniques for storing and leveraging this further to processing with just 1-network-call
        - I do have solid grip on doing in-memory processing  with either mutations or immutable techniques for larger data-sets in millions in pratice and  in theory it holds good for billions as well, again few custom techniques, tricks
        - as an engineer, if you are excited on leveraging cloud-object-stores to full potential for historical data usecases , then my expertize, may be worth while to consider.
        - I also have great interest in using serverless FAAS technologies
        - [math-works](#math-works)
        - I like my-work to speak-about-me, than a designation, it could be misleading-to-you, as it does-to-me (Wipro's architect is one quote from mine)
        
- I'm also open for contract to hire for 6 months or little more, with some negotiations on my billing.
- If you are looking for an IC role, please check on relevant sections that interests you
- Future-thoughts
    - I do have a thought of being an independent-consultant or an agency of few-like minded people, though its down the road 5+ years
 
## Domain Exposure
- More to come on this space

- ### Retail
    - [Company-1-Tomax Jun-2005 to Sep-2009](my-work-experiences.md#company-1-tomax-jun-2005-to-sep-2009)
    - willingess to work again - BIG,YES
- ### Financial Services
    - [Client-3 : Societe Generalle](#client-3--societe-generalle)
    - willingess to work again - BIG,YES
        - I have my own personal interst in stocks, so though the math, regulation is hard, still a good challenging one to work with
- ### Telecom
    - [Client-1 : Verizon Data Services](#client-1--verizon-data-services)
    - willingess to work again - very unlikely
        - on  core telecom : Big No
        - Unless a business analyst or FO or SME on domain, does a spoon fooding on the domain, its factors, its difficult to make sense on the domain, 
            - on a side note,  WRAN, RAN, eNodeB etc of Ericsson expereience still rings a bell in my head.
- ### Aviation
    - so far [aviation-domain-exposure](#aviation-domain-exposure)
    - automations-encountered-so-far : rolling up cost, multi-modeling on data-science for useful insights, in-house billing 
    - software-scope : inhouse for GEs internal analysts
    - MRO, modeling needs for analysts, pretty much lot of scope for advandced analytics     
    -  willingess to work again - BIG,YES
        - Since childhood I am excited, seeing airplanes fly, so its very fascinating to work again on this domain.
- ### Billing
    - [project-3 billing, reconciliation ](#project-3-billing-reconciliation)
    - Though it was an in house solution built for GE, due to  a year's end-to-end exposure and  based on my maturity got to know pretty much a typical standard buisness equation and  higher order math. It could be a over simplification but a good one to start on a dicussion.
        - $$ billedValue = utilization * money * optionalFactors$$
            - utilization could be a time unit of engine/telecom connection usage in hours/second respectively
            - money could be $ , ₹, € etc
                - in aviation due to a long term service aggreement, they do have some called escalation rate, i m sure, this could hold for other domains as well
            - optionalFactors are very intersting as they could increase or decrease
                - in aviation we have interpolated severity factors on certain thresholds like temperature, utilization, thrust used by pilot, cycles etc
                - in telecom it could be a discounted rate above 1 hour or unlimited plan
                - discount rate for x customer
                - xyz specific to domain
    - willingess to work again - BIG,YES

    
- ### Future Domains - interstig-me
        - healthcare, geo spatial, xyz business-automations and re discovering with a cheaper cost
        - you have a big bang on modernization
            

## Future Thoughts | intersting-work-areas
- ### synthesising on domain-data
    - taking distinct values of each factors of domain, its possible to create many permuations and combinations of them, interplay with them. Simulation is probably one thing to start with 
- ### geo-spatial problems
    - latitude, longitude, altitude, humidity, temperature, wind speed
- ### pyramid of mental, phyical, social well being
    - personas(kids,teens,youths,)
    - building antidotes-of-software for attention-grabbing-social-softwares like anti-social-trends 
    - flagging on macho-mannerisms of ads on smoking, alchohol, crime (like ) 





## math-works
- lets check how much records we can process with limited ram of 8gb
- step-1: assuming 1kb record with unique columnar data(20 to 30 columns) 
- step-2: we have a scale of 1000 records, this implies roughly 1MB
- step-3: we have 1000 * 1000 records = 1million records 1gb
- step-4: we have a compute with 8gb ram = 8 million records with 8gb :: this couldbe in raspberry pi 4/5 with 8gb ram
- step-5: scaling vertically we could go higher to 16gb(16 million records) or 32gb (32 million records)
- step-6: as we now see RAMs getting costlier we can think of scaling horizontaly and distribute the load say stateles-http request with 2 or 3 machines(roughly 100 million records) in theory roughly we could also process it in 12 raspberry pi 4/5 with 8gb rams
- note in step 2, 3 I took a worst case scenario in normal business scenarios this not the case and with encoding and compression even in 8gb ram we could literally store 10x of step-4 say 80 to 100 million.
- on a side note we could also eliminate some unwanted columns which dont make sense, if are doing an aggregation logic
- in java i have a good grip on hashing(immutable-structures like string, numbers), leveraging further on business-domain-attributes,  and complementing above with hashing becomes powerful enough to do in O(1) search,insertions
- Next we could leverage the multicores, ghz of cpu to process faster if we need to 
- above is checklist or litmus test when i hear huge data in brainstorming
- usually the business equations are stright-forward automations of arithmetic, algebraic equations, unless we move towards analytics, data-science, ML 
- [an-engineer-since-2019](#an-engineer-since-2019) - this might also interest you.
- project-2 and project-3 of [Company-4-GE Oct-2018 Jan-2024](my-work-experiences.md#company-4-ge-oct-2018-jan-2024) have been solutioned based on above mathematical theories which involved millions of rows
## Cultural Fitness
- Each org has unique culture, each individual might view it differently, You could have your own perception of your organization,company
- Below is mine
- primarily result, outcome oriented, open minded
-  social  at (face2face,phone,sms) not at whatsapp,telegram etc to avoid-news-gossips
- in my view god is binary, i choose 0, but like to go for archiecture,hill-view, on religous places, monuments
- food (coffe,tea, seafood,traditional,authentic indian cusine) generally have very low perferces for star rated food, especially coporate-ones
- for lesiure prefer  progressive-music, movies(sci-fic,non-fic(true-story-inspire, biographical))
    - i do watch movies in many languages(english,hindi,kannada,tamil,malayalam,telgu,korean etc)
- love to  travel(mountains, jungles, beaches, historical-monuments for architecture)
- love to shop in decathlon for everything, including office, bike, hiking wearables.
- i dont understand politics and dont like to be involved in office polictics as well  , though i am not too blind at voting
- I am quite selective in my work, once picked I do commit till its completed.
- I do like sharing knowledge, teaching, selective mentoring etc
- I prefer challenging work, where in, I can improvise on the solutions, mostly for novel-business-problems
    - I typically dont like to stick to any company for job-safety, for reptitive-work and solutioning
    - It will be dishonesty to my beliefs, to take pure maintenance and support work
- [My Work Style](#my-work-style) - this might also be interesting.

- [Teaching Mentoring](#teaching-mentoring)
## Teaching Mentoring
- In my [Company-1-Tomax Jun-2005 to Sep-2009](my-work-experiences.md#company-1-tomax-jun-2005-to-sep-2009) after we got trained for 6 months, company tasked us to mentor the next 2 batches (3 to 4 people)  for subsequent years, they were amazing with lot of energy, curiosity and  we also got better by teaching them based. We had to keep upto date with technology-trends like J2EE at that time. It also improvised my vocabulary
- In [Company-2-CSC Dec-2009 to Mar-201](my-work-experiences.md#company-2-csc-dec-2009-to-mar-2016) at the client manager(verizon) after gaining 1.5 years of trust and relationship, was open enough in tasking us (csc-colleagues) to mentor their 1st batch of fresh college engineers whom they had hired probably for  diversity. We shared a lot, laughed a lot, it was fun with them. 1 person had keen interest in solving with performance and my luck also he got assigned to my team. He always challenged the solutions which we were baking, it was good exercise for me as I mentored him.
  on my next assigment with client Societe Generalle, I mentored to certain extent on experienced like 5+ years
  - In [Company-3-Wipro Apr-2016 Jul-2018](my-work-experiences.md#company-3-wipro-apr-2016-jul-2018), I met a young developer 2+ years or so whom I taught few things on technical and he taught me several things on business-domain, he was the goto person if I had any doubts in business the way it worked
  - In [Company-4-GE Oct-2018 Jan-2024](my-work-experiences.md#company-4-ge-oct-2018-jan-2024) perhaps this is the one where in I have mentored a lot ranging from 2+ to 8+
    - on my 1st assignment, as I was disovering myself on several things,  closely taught and shared almost everything I learnt from conferences like GIDS, to  3 to 4 GE-engineers , 1-vendor-partner because of their curiosity, open-minded culture
    - on my second assigment, though I shared all nosql learning with larger vendor-centric-team, accidentally I trained 1 vendor-partner on lot of hashing and low-level techniques assuming him to be 3 to 4 years. It was after a month or so that I realized that he had only 5 to 6 months of experencice. He was damn good at figuring out a low-level shall-cloning bug which I was struggling to figure out

## Autonomy-on-problem-solving over designation,Position,money
- If you have top 3 problems and you care about outcome,result than routine process below might help
    - autonomy to form a small team of my own would be a great help 
    - In my view and experience  team with good matching frequency and autonomy(tools,techniques,time-mgmt) does a lot more than expected and as lead or team-member I ensure or contribute to the best of my knowledge
- normally in big organizations, the horizontal-ride
- vertical-ride
- hub and spoke model


 
## My Quick Bites on Problem Solving
- These are some of my approaches, techniques, strategies when the business-domain to technical-domain  is well-understood 
    - looking and identifying core domain attributes necessary for the overall automation-math
- arithmetic, % for size, occasional binary manipulation
- evaluation of loop-controls (for,streams,)
    - for,while - they give precise grip and fine grained control and tradeoff for verboseness and complexity of indicies
    - streams, collections - they give readability, high order math, functional-oriented, with a tradeoff on fine grained control, 
- crafting-and-controlling mutable-state as it gets into some useful transformation like aggregations, rollups, reductions etc
- crafting immutable-structures for business permutations, combinations 
- heavy usage of hashing-in-java-context for O(1) performance
- structing-low-level(pkg-by-feature,nested-classes, static-utilities,non-static-state-controls) 
- threading : usually leverage http-stateless per-request-thread(virtual-threads), per-event-async-thread(for-complex-scenearios only)
- dynamic-2d-array-apis(custom-built) lever
    - my goto solution for front-end problems when they have to populate a matrix of data, if they ask repeatedly
-  data-pull and compute with custom-techniques at 1-network-call, system-calls, IO 

## Software Design
- My Take, Biased Opinions, Views, Perceptions
- My Biased Techniques, strategies, approaches

## A Bit On Software design 
- The definition [Software design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design) is a good one to start with.
    - from-wiki : Software design is the process of conceptualizing how a software system will work before it is implemented or modified.
    - Modeling - a thorough research with multiple views on business flows, data flows  with proper directions identifying push/pull model, permuations of uses and its weightage is more important than anything else to kick start the design
        - identifying the organic inputs and outputs is also very crucial
        - for communicating with other on the ideas we need some tools 
        - I usually pick flow-charts, data-flow-diagrams, spreadsheets-with-actual, confluence etc
        - on a side note Usually when I join a project probably to design a feature, I get to see a custom-tailored cloud-provider referenece-architecture-diagram, which in my view is the worst thing to start with unless I have been tasked to troubleshoot or fix a operational-infra issue.
- Purpose :  should solve the domain-problem factoring evolving-biz-changes, it should be communicable, more than anything should highlight the alternaive-approaches, techinques, tradeoffs take to arrive at the design
- chaos of choices, tradeoffs
- juggle of choices often are  based on hype, practicality, familiarity, trend, proven-track record, past-experience, accidental-academic-choice(like-mine), the way we percieve or have analogy with real-world to software
    - Probably the biggest problem is in the imgaination of computing, storing, processing, communicating
    - a good one will, evaluate if the software-api-tools are cheap enough to solve the biz problem in an optimal-cost
- Software design itself could mean many things like api-design, component-design, system-design, DDD, evolevable-design, etc
- it could simply mean a set of microservices over on-prem, cloud(IAAS, PAAS, SAAS, FAAS) 
    - again there is  constant juggle on granularity of microserices, their communication-styles orchestration and choreograhy
- biz-stakeholders like to hear our software/tool/app is  extenisible, usable, cost-effective, high-performant and may not be tech-centric ilities like  scalbility, security, modularity, compatibility, robust, fault-tolerant etc 
    - sure most will just knod their head on hearing ilities but only few could have deeper understanding of it or truly understand it 
- My offer on software-design
    - put the domain-problem to be automated at the center and start picking the cheapest-software-api-tools and try satisfying(bring-balance) multiple stakeholders 
        - biz : extenisible, usable, cost-effective, high-performant and build trust enabling new biz capabilities, un-explored-manual-touchpoints like laborious data-entry
        - dev : balance on techilities and build trust on automating the right way with right tools 
        - mgmt :  minimize on cost(development, financial)  to begin with and build trust ensuring that software works on odd-times 
    - Though the original idea is to keep/make lot of stakeholders, the primary focus will be always to bring everone the core of the domain-problem and be a catalyst, a-tourist-guide on choices we make and take.
    -  Though I could be wrong in generalizing, many fail becuase they focus too much on a minority of stakeholders like biz, dev, management

## Design Principles
- Software Design with SOLID, CUPID, UNIX Philosophy
- whom to follow 
    - first why not to follow, blindly
        - GoF author didnt write J2EE pattern, microservices
        - Some authors did thier marketed well based on their pressing  problems they percieved, while people like me as well try to catch up these someone else solved the problem differently creating new hype, buzz, trend etc. so its difficult to stick any one technologist-pioneer's view. like medicine, we designers, architects have to keep updating frequently yearly or so to update our view.
    - its better to follow people who authored continuously several things with decades of exposure and kept updating thier view.
        - few people whose work has influenced me  [Martin Fowler](https://www.martinfowler.com/), [Neal Ford](https://nealford.com/) [Gregor Hohpe](https://architectelevator.com/) 
- what to adopt and why not to 
    - what not to
        - java-context : once upon a time these were trending dinosarus servlet, jsp, JSF, EJBs etc ofcourse they aren't extinct but lying in some legacy software, refactoring,modernizing them could be tricky and challenging 
            - on a side note  their concepts, patterns have been moved to higher order abstraction like @restcontroler, @entity
    - what to then, like MCU loki's "He Who Remains"
        - techniques, approaches,  fundamentals like stateless-true-distributed-http, tcp/ip, encapsulation, moudularization, messaging-concepts , multithreading, event processing and handling, algorithms, data-structures
- eval(SOLID,CUPID,unix-philosophy) , generally prefer CUPID and unix philosophy over SOLID becuase in practice SOLID didnt help me to model the domain problem really
    - i would also like to put a strong opinion that irrespective of what we choose, its not visible to customer, end-user one excpetion ofcourse is if  you r shipping a open-source tool,library 
    - so picking is choice of architect, designer, engineer to a-good-developer
    - the key idea no matter what we pick should be cater the evolving needs of business problem 
        - in my view, this holds good in building all sorts of application needs 
        - operational aka transactional 
        - analytical  to advanced anlytics using ML, AI technlologies
            - inspite of cheapest object cloud-storage comanies, dont have data ready for advanced analytics, most of it is RDBMs and mostly for couple of years, all being truncated/deleted not storing archiving aws-s3 for example
            - on a side note with all the hype in AI, identifying useful USE CASEs like smartphone did to us,  is yet to happen or i am yet to hear/discover
            - 
        - realtime streaming 
        -
## Patterns 
- if time-is-money, we save TIME and MONEY both by leveraging or avoiding anti-patterns, someone's (person, team, org)   solution to a repitive-problem-space    to a contrained-domain-space or bounded-context
- pattern : context-driven, recurring, time-saving, common-vocab-for-a-reptivive-problem's solution, 
- anti-pattern :
    - the biggest anti-pattern is every single pattern extremely-good-one also applied for a wrong-context undersntanding the problem-domain
        -  may it was trending and you wanted to add in your resume/cv for pattern-matching, mis-understood its use-cases, other show-off-stuff, many possiblities
- for any pattern for its efficacy, my recomendation cum approach is discuss with several colleagues, research on its use-cases, try it first on small blast-radius, then apply for larger-one, especially when it touches the core of business-problem 
- Gof patterns
    - again this is not visible to customer, end-user 
    - a little research on backgroud will take you to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_language both kickstart you with enough wisdom to build custom patterns as per the domain
    - if u r an aware :  the original authors didnt invent them, they just identified and documented, so its more of discovery than invention, but Chistopher did popularize the term pattern is often attributed to father of pattern.
    - first these are very low-level Object Oriented patterns, they are really useful if you are building a library(aws-sdk) etc so domain of application really depends on the domain probelm at hand.
    -   i have heavily leveraged builder, factories, adapter, facade if you expect me know everyting and check my knowledge on these probably I am a  wrong fit
- J2EE, JEE pattern
- [EAV-data-model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93attribute%E2%80%93value_model)

## Domain Driven Design
- [Domain-driven design ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design)
    - this is what i leverage in most solving all business problem, be it automation of billing, rolling up cost for million records, partitioning stratgies for data-modeling, scaling on data-volume growth, security(internet,intranet)
    - if you agree a lot on this, probably we can jump on this dicussion first.
    - please do screen me heavily on this, it will help you in I am good fit.
    - please dont hire/work with me 
        - if you are hearing first time and you still found a  better way to solve the problem
        - you dont like this design not matter what
- from a clould-computing per-se also the from evolution to options, in-my view point to only one thing to accelarate on solving business problem or to automate it with evolving-business-needs from on-premise to XAAS( IAAS -> PAAS -> SAAS , FAAS )
- retirement to replatform
    - in most of my experience and observations the core-business-domain its operating-principles more or less remain same like in typical ecommerce order,inventory,payment, shipping and in manufacturing(MRO,supply-chain) with few deltas
        -  user-personas may change
        - traditional ways of doing it might change   
        - new digital tools got cheaper
        - renting out or leveraging cloud
        - on a side note 



- [Data Modeling](#data-modeling)
## Data Modeling 
- more of what worked for-me-so-far
- strong opinion on partitioning data on the biz domain attributes for ex product, customer, time etc
    - I am constantly looking for new techniques and strategies to add to my data-modeling-toolkit
- in my experience most of projects I have worked have modelled synthectic attributes in storage and worst these get exposed on several integration as well, so getting right here is fundamental for future scalability, integration, extensibilty like adding a new product or customer 
- constraints on the biz domain also help a lot , it has helped in many situations to constrain the solution-space

- [System Thinking](#system-thinking)
## System Thinking
- system-thinking
    - In my view, I would  like to think of it has set of structures {str-1,str-2,...str-n} and behaviors {bhvr1,b2....bn } with some degree of dependency, coupling, coheshion between each structure, behaviour,  change in one can causing ripple-effect based on how they are built, communicating-with-bridges-channels  
        - on a side note, a good analogy to civil structures, bridges, flats-in-apartments, townships with schools,hospitals to form complex ecosystems of towns, cities
    - combination of them then make several  useful-systems( deeply-nested-dependent,  tightly/loosely coupled over a communication-channel)
    - some factors to consider on operational-stuff like  dynamic-load, distributed-nature, replication-need, peak-it-can-handle(with-orinial-intent to ungoing or future-need)
    - primary factors to consider while building 
        - communication
        - coupling
        - cohesion
        - domain/problem its trying to solve

- [Software Architecture](#software-architecture)
## Software Architecture
- in my view and observation sofar, the evolution of it has heavy influence from civil, manufacturing, shipping-containers, rental-space(cloud) etc to start-with, so its recommended to be a good observer looking at several realworld entities like below to kickstart  as opposed to famous management-lesson to be a good listner unless your domain is music, movies, microsoft-teams, crime-investigator etc 
    - civil : structures(pillars), bridges, flats-in-apartments, townships with schools,hospitals to form complex ecosystems of towns, cities
    - logistics : shipping, stacked-containers, 
    - manufacturing : supply-chain, inventory, order
    - hospitality : hotels, homestays, hostels
- the point : There is a default design and architecture everywhere(planets revolving, mighty Sun) even if didn't intended 
- based on our views it may  be application, cloud, system, enterprise, 
- it also could be dynamic, static, modular, 
- [J2EE to JEE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta_EE) this was the standard till till spring and spring boot with

## an-engineer-since-2019
- attempting to being like one, thinking like one, 
    - what good i am if dont talk about processing MBs to GBs in  Ghz, in a operating system process, probably due to an event trigger to http-request thread having fetched  a gb of data from a storage like database/s3 
    - with some just basic arithmetic its possible to process the data once in-memory RAM either through mutation of heap or immutable functional programming with streams library in java having some good grip on the way JVM works.
    - its quite possible to build a theory on approximate time usually in seconds to process the amount of data(MBs to GBs)
        - on a side note for big-data technologies Apache-Spark excites me or promises me to process memory on more than 1 node in memory
        - in near future, getting a good grip on this might make me a good developer to build data-pipelines for big-data, machine-learning data space
    - from a perspective of an engineer frankly i wasn't  smart enough to understand in my (4 year engineering  + 13 years software development) that makes 17 years
        - on a side note later to come back again
        -  I had 1 good mentor who gave me some basic understanding in my 2 years of my career at first company
        - i think first company experience will shape you a lot, atleast it made a good developer though not engineer
        - his first teaching
            - you imagine the problem wholistically to which you are coding , dont run trial and error to see the output
             when you are convinced that 90% you are done, execute it, with 10% change or correction you should be able to generate the desired output solving the probelem.
             i took this concept so far that i am notorious not to run my code till i am convince even for days to week based on the complexity of work, and still generate the desired output.
             most of the time i dont test my code, i ask  testers/qa to run all comibnations, give them my own context and scenarios so that i can pick next complex stuff to solve.
        - its my first mentor whom I should give a lot  of credit for shaping me up
    - trust me, i understood all the above,  after 13 years of software development and as i came across these technologies
    - many thanks goes to parallel developments when i got introduced to concepts since 2018 on below
        - cloud computing  
        - dev-ops culture now its dev-sec-ops (largely due to AI penetration) 
            - on a side note since nov 2022 chatgpt boom its  ML-ops, LLM-ops
        - microservices
        - cicd pipeline
        - nosql development, success stories
            - so 2018, 2019 was a tough year to digest and apply in practice, with less guidance and lot of researching etc 
        - 12-factor app, api gateway, Oauth,
            - what to pick  all this for good reason.
    - though all these technologies were there since early 2000s probably even before , I have to admit, I probably wasnt passionate enough to look early, however  since 2018 its good think as an engineer as opposed to developer
    - another reason  being obscured by on-prem deployment team organization, we didnt had visibility what happend once the executable jar, war,ear tested and built, we usually heard another team will take care of it.
        - cloud , devops, microservices togther broke this silo concern we got visibity to G
    - 2019 April conferences [GIDS](https://developersummit.com/)
        -  2 day programme , though i was sponsored for a single day, a colleague of mine cancelled i got another day chance to attend, which i was delighted
        - This changed my perception of building software design, architecture, microservice granularity, mis conception of 12-factor app as a standard, 
    - since college days i was fascinated towards storage-devices, PCs(cpu,ram) and i was always curious in understanding how to leverage on   cpu speed(3ghz) and storage-speed(nvme.m2(5GB/s)))
        - some how this has also  helped me to understand storage and compute solution better
        - back in college days i was also fascinated with GPU but seeing cost and its application(gaming, 3d-modeling), i kept away from researching it, and kept buying built in with CPU till date.

        - [energy-efficiency](https://thenewstack.io/which-programming-languages-use-the-least-electricity/)
        - [awspblog - Rust is also interesting](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/sustainability-with-rust/?pg=devrust)
- My stack, my View on  Java & a bit on its Ecosystem
- At low-level lot of core-java conecpts are pretty much neutral and  common to data-structure, algorithms in general. My grip strongly comes from having deeper understanding on java internals, aggregation on large-object-graphs, multhreading contol, hashing techniques of java.
- Relevant:  
### microservices
    - Springboot 5+
    - with [](#software-design-by-domain-driven-design)
### data-centric 3+years
- of course in my 18years, i have seen the evoultion of lot of Java technogies many fading to constantly flourshing like Spring, spring-boot, Jdbc
- its multi-paradigm 
- what i personally like in java one side is imperative sytle,  fine grained control on mutation of objects for large data sets , imagining a thread on jvm heap of course we have to trade off the heavy verbose code for it. 
- also for my thinking style, JVM , its memory model, garbage-collection techniques, multithreading, concurrency etc suite well , probably in few of my attempts I failed to understand this in python
- just see below database technologies written in java, if you would like to research more.
- if you are new to java or need to know what stuff could be built with to excite you or broaden on mindset
    - [dynamodb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_DynamoDB), [cassandra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Cassandra) [kafka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Kafka) [neo4j](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo4j)
- jdk-21 
    - in my view , the most promising release  after java-8,  I am yet to leverage java 9 modularity yet in some real world project
    - very exciting with virtural-threads, just a conigruation-change(spring.thread-executor=virtual) in springboot should boost performance, though i need to test for a heavy thread centric micro-service in pilot mode, before productionizing it. 
    - record pattern, simplicity at best with implicit(immutablity,adaptive defaults), data-oriented programming,
        - complemented with streams we could do some good aggregations, reduction with 1-step closer towards matrix operations
        - atleast we  can now get rid of lombok annotation, 
- just my view dont take it to heart if you are still using EJB, applets etc - Rephrase
    - some flourish and current trend (spring,springboot) leveraging aop, DI, cloud integrations
    - ehy EJB failed near to endagered (EJB) , in my view also http-statless helps a lot, so stateful bean, hyped entity beans didnt make sense as data-volume growth increased
    - to extinct(Java applet) 
- ### flourishing And Relevant Java Stack
- [springboot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
    - this is a game changer in java for building production ready microservices 
    - leveraging cloud integration support, 
    - vast data-acess libraries from simple-powerful-jdbc to nosql(cassandra,neo4j)
- JDBC
    - my goto tool to access data
    - @JDBCTemplate simplifies all the boiler plate and good to use especially while pulling large data sets in batch, complex sql joins for transparency (orm tools really fail here only in my view and experience)
    - ofcourse for simple cases could be replaced by @Entity from spring
[comment]: to add to my stack Micronaut, and Quarkus | learning tools such as ELKI, DL4J, and JAVA-ML | 
    
- ### My Java Old-Stack
- experience-in-building :  
    ### desktop-application first 6+ years
    - [Java Swing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(Java)), tables, tabletrees, gridbaglayouts(my-goto-layout-manager)
    -  I pretty much built whatever came to me, end-to-end with backend jdbc/hibernate/ejb 
    - notable works to recall inventory-search, appoinment-scheduler, HQ-store-hierarchy,field-technician-application, 
    - had build lot reubsable-components be it at user-interface level or backing data-models especially leveraging components
        - on a side note, also had worked on a proprietary RIA canoo ULC , which was a half-object server side technology
    - last used 2014
    ### web-applications 
        - Servlet, JSP, JSF EJBs, Hibernate backed by JBOSS, now wildfly servers
        - back in those times we used several custom patterns like facade, dto, dao layers to leverage on these verbose technologies.
        - last used 2014
    ### mobile-application 2+years
    - blackberry-field-technician-app, primarily leveraged more or less the knowledge of java-swing over here, 
    - last used 2012
    ### web services 1+years
    - soapful-webservices, officially this is my first web 
- a bit on technologies once like dinosaurs and now pretty much superceeded by annotations @Restcontroller, @Service
- servlet 
    - first J2ee technology to serve data on top of http-request-response library component in 2000s now abstracted by Spring framework by @Restcontroller
- JSP
    - dynamic content + static html served by underlying servlet technology, no more relevant now
- JSF
    - building web components as a developer, i didnt like it much, never got comfortable with it, as i recall it was due to verbose of tagging and inflexibility etc
- CORBA 
    - it was really complex to understand and complex enough to explain now as well
    - just FYI in case intersted, then as I recall it helped even  hetergeneous  java, c++ objects to communicate with interfaces and technology defined by corba-interfaces
- RMI (simply superceded by @RestController)
    - last used 2016, 2017
    - first basic block of distributed programming in java
    - uses socket programing  leveraging tcp/ip with java interfaces 
    - java agnostic not hetergenous like Corba
- SOAP  (simply superceded by @RestController from spring)
    - last used in 2014,2015
    - xml over http , to serve data
    - Restful architectural style did a good job in getting rid of strict-xml-schema-wsdl-verbose
    - this is my first web api development experience around 2012
    - had good exposure to  xml-parsers( sax and jax ) , a bit of http

## Fascinating Technologies
- [wheels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel)
    - world runs on wheel, in my house also I like everything to be wheels, easy to clean, readjust space if we have to accomodate more guests
    - lot of innovation goes from wood to rubber to precision-ball-heads(steel,aluminum) 
- [AC from War of Currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_currents)
    - if Alternating Current wasn't popularized and made accessible to common people like us then several technogies wouldn't have been simply possible
    - watch out dramtatic movie on above [The_Current_War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Current_War) 
    - FYI ending war gave rise to [General Electric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Electric) interstingly i worked for GE  for 5 years
    - probably fear and idea,  are inte-connected, they create innnovation to serve large scale  at low cost
- [civil-engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_engineering)
    - all the advancements from 1 floor strucuture to high-rise-apartments,townships, historical-monuments, airports, statues, towers, dams, bridges, roads , flyovers etc
    - in facto lot of software design, patterns are heavily influenced by this discipline, so its a good analogy to see what happening in real world physical structure.
    - proabably a mathematcial error could cause deaths at scale like dam
    - software-jargons (pillar, foundation, factories, facade, bridge, )
    - if you still dont agree with me, please take a look at this one of my favourite goto book on  role of software architect https://architectelevator.com/ if this excites take a look at this https://www.patternlanguage.com/
        - this is just to understand the intersection of two disciplines
    - its important to observe patterns in this field and real-world
- [www](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WorldWideWeb)  by inventor [Sir Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee)

    - yeah i donate annually, though many times i feel to contribute frequently, may be near-future quarterly
    - without this i wouldnt be here, being what I am now

    - My experiences with [My Java Stack & Few Titbits](#my-java-stack--few-titbits)
- [raspberrypi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) 
    - this is the most fasicnating computer [SBCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-board_computer) i have seen so far
    - most of the times, the solution I am building, I imagine if i could fit in 8Gb Pi4(₹8k), yet to try pi5
    - This is good computing contraint to me
- [aws-s3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_S3) 
    - any cloud object store should be fine including from google, microsoft, xyz
    - atleast this is  what i am familiar with for now, with its constraints(3500put, 5000get) per-second for per-prefix triggers a engineering math which we could leverage to model  many solutions to many unique-problems, espcessially analytical computations and storage options 
    - with $23 per tb, this has become a factor to think interms of scale, storage-cost, ofcourse 99.9999 promise of durability
    - on s3 put, trigger a lambda to do useful stuff, have configured for many retaining many versions, plenty of options to think of
    - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html
- [sql](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL)
     - dorminant since 1970s, not going anywhere near sool, 
     -  Power of delcatariveness, set-therory,  to tell what we want and not on how to
     - we tell what we want in english, it gives what we want, then engine keeeps changing by vendor and we reap benenfit, provided db-engine is open-source, or ur paying premium for commerical-one fits your budget
     - sql, nosql(surprisingly u still write SQL in nosql-technology)
     - Evev with advanced analytics technologies of  ML push, AI, sql unlikely go away , its that powerful or  we just want to leverage on the universal standard-ANSI sql interface to the fullest 
     -ofcourse times have changed for good  rathar than running sql on traditional 2d matrix on rdbms, now we could be running on top of csv,parquet,json etc with some library/cloud-service acting as sql-engine on top of cloud-object-store or data-lake etc
     - aws-s3-select api over s3-bucket for objects(csv,parquet, json) has also opened new doors for me to solve some modeling to  analytical problems significantly
     - from big-data to ML problems,  data-lakehouse  query-engines backing sql interfaces also reassures that sql is not going anwhere in near future as well and shows its expansion from rdbms -> data-warehouse -> data-lakes(object-stores ) -> lakehouse(query-engines from analytics to data-movement needs)
