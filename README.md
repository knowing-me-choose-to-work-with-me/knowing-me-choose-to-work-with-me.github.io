## Bit On Title
- Though objective is to be self-exlpainatory,  Some other titles that i had thought of 
    - knowing-me-support-me, knowing-me-hire-me, hire-me-fire-me-once-job-is-done, rent-me-6-months, [knowing Me, Knowing You - ABBA-song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowing_Me,_Knowing_You))


## Site Motivation
Motivation for this site, from a perspective of  hiring-me or choosing-to-work-with-me 
It's difficult to put all our thoughts in condensed 2 page resume, this is  more of a open book to my experiences.
Also, in my experiences, so far, while working to solve a core-business-problem, friction is unavoidable, mostly demands lot more time and energy, we usually have have lot of differences in opinions, culuture, thoughts, methodologies, approaches, problem-solving-skills, real-time-experiences, the way we perceive real-world and software-world etc.
This is a open book of my mine, to  help minimize friction towards me, you and us, to make us more comfortable, familiar in our ideas, thoughts and creativity. Hopefully,  this site helps you understand me better on my rationale choices and  you welcome me with a open mindset

## about me 
- Prashanth T R, myself a  Software Engineer having 18years of experience in IT with research-first mindset, building and automating for data-centric novel-business-problems
    - all business problems are unique and they need a customized solution built for its purpose, constrant-space
    - the research is not to burn the cash of the company but to find low-cost-effective technology solution, they typically involve few weeks, parallely while trying to understand the business we are suppose to automate
    - by automation, I mean as  simple as arithmetic to algebraic to advanced ones(regression,interpoloation,xyz)  to a  scale (multiplied by domain like nubmer of products, customers, time etc) because deep down thats what I have encountered so far.
    - by data centric I usually mean the volume of equations to be automated say like thousands to millions to billions with some busniess-rules which are specific to the domain context of the problem
## One Reason To Work With Me
- You want just one reason to figure out if i will be a good fit or not for your team, for your current set of problems
    - Given enough autonomy on solving the business-problem, I typically form a small team(3 to 4 people) apply a feature-driven-development splitting with a mental-model of organic business-flows (say 1 to 10 or so), showing/demonstrating business with new capabilities(automation), carefully crafting for core-important-flows say (4 to 6) identified with verifiable weightage (60 to 80)% giving business stakeholder with  few design-options which they can choose based on cost-factors like development(scoped-to-time), competence, financial and opportunity with cost-effective technology solutions. 
        - I have proven track record of $23/tb on custom-techniques for storing and leveraging this further to processing with just 1-network-call
        - I do have solid grip on doing in-memory processing  with either mutations or immutable techniques for larger data-sets in millions in pratice and  in theory it holds good for billions as well, again few custom techniques, tricks
        - as an engineer, if you are excited on leveraging cloud-object-stores to full potential for historical data usecases , then my expertize, may be worth while to consider.
        - I also have great interest in using serverless FAAS technologies
        - [math-works](#math-works)
        - I like my-work to speak-about-me, than a designation, it could be misleading-you, as it does-me
- I'm also open for contract to hire for 6 months, with some negotiations on my billing.
- If you are looking for an IC role, please check on relevant sections.
- Future-thoughts
    - I do have a thought of being an independent-consultant or agency of few-like minded people, though its down the road of 3 to 5 years

## math-works
- lets check how much records we can process with limited ram of 8gb
- step-1: assuming 1kb record with unique columnar data(20 to 30 columns) 
- step-2: we have a scale of 1000 records, this implies roughly 1MB
- step-3: we have 1000 * 1000 records = 1million records 1gb
- step-4: we have a compute with 8gb ram = 8 million records with 8gb :: this couldbe in raspberry pi 4/5 with 8gb ram
- step-5: scaling vertically we could go higher to 16gb(16 million records) or 32gb (32 million records)
- step-6: as we now see RAMs getting costlier we can think of scaling horizontaly and distribute the load say stateles-http request with 2 or 3 machines(roughly 100 million records) in theory roughly we could also process it in 12 raspberry pi 4/5 with 8gb rams
- note in step 2, 3 I took a worst case scenario in normal business scenarios this not the case and with encoding and compression even in 8gb ram we could literally store 10x of step-4 say 80 to 100 million.
- on a side note we could also eliminate some unwanted columns which dont make sense, if are doing an aggregation logic
- in java i have a good grip on hashing(immutable-structures like string, numbers), leveraging further on business-domain-attributes,  and complementing above with hashing becomes powerful enough to do in O(1) search,insertions
- Next we could leverage the multicores, ghz of cpu to process faster if we need to 
- above is checklist or litmus test when i hear huge data in brainstorming
- usually the business equations are stright-forward automations of arithmetic, algebraic equations, unless we move towards analytics, data-science, ML

- Each org has unique culture, each individual might view it differently, You could have your own perception of your organization,company
- Below is mine
- primarily result, outcome oriented, open minded
-  social  at (face2face,phone,sms) not at whatsapp,telegram etc to avoid-news-gossips
- in my view god is binary, i choose 0, but like to go for archiecture,hill-view, on religous places, monuments
    - please dont screen me - if you have a  strong ideology or weightage on any particular religion,geography,language
    - on as side not i watch movies in 
- food (coffe,tea, seafood,traditional,authentic indian cusine) generally have very low perferces for star rated food, especially coporate-ones
- for lesiure prefer  progressive-music, movies(sci-fic,non-fic(true-story-inspire, biographical))
    - i do watch movies in many languages(english,hindi,kannada,tamil,malayalam,telgu,korean etc)
- love to  travel(mountains, jungles, beaches, historical-monuments for architecture)
- love to shop in decathlon for everything I need including office, bike, hiking wearables.
- i dont understand politics and dont like to be involved in office polictics as well  , though i am not too blind at voting
- I am quite selective in my work, once picked I do commit till its completed.
- I do like sharing knowledge, teaching, selective mentoring etc
- i prefer challenging work where in can improvise on the solutions, mostly for novel-business-problems
- [My Work Style](#my-work-style) - this might also be interesting.

## Teaching Mentoring
- In my [Company-1-Tomax Jun-2005 to Sep-2009](#company-1-tomax-jun-2005-to-sep-2009) after we got trained for 6 months, company tasked us to mentor the next 2 batches (3 to 4 people)  for subsequent years, they were amazing with lot of energy, curiosity and  we also got better by teaching them based. We had to keep upto date with technology-trends like J2EE at that time. It also improvised my vocabulary
- In [Company-2-CSC Dec-2009 to Mar-201](#company-2-csc-dec-2009-to-mar-2016) at the client manager(verizon) after gaining 1.5 years of trust and relationship, was open enough in tasking us (csc-colleagues) to mentor their 1st batch of fresh college engineers whom they had hired probably for  diversity. We shared a lot, laughed a lot, it was fun with them. 1 person had keen interest in solving with performance and my luck also he got assigned to my team. He always challenged the solutions which we were baking, it was good exercise for me as I mentored him.
  on my next assigment with client Societe Generalle, I mentored to certain extent on experienced like 5+ years
  - In [Company-3-Wipro Apr-2016 Jul-2018](#company-3-wipro-apr-2016-jul-2018), I met a young developer 2+ years or so whom I taught few things on technical and he taught me several things on business-domain, he was the goto person if I had any doubts in business the way it worked
  - In [Company-4-GE Oct-2018 Jan-2024](#company-4-ge-oct-2018-jan-2024) perhaps this is the one where in I have mentored a lot ranging from 2+ to 8+
    - on my 1st assignment, as I was disovering myself on several things,  closely taught and shared almost everything I learnt from conferences like GIDS, to  3 to 4 GE-engineers , 1-vendor-partner because of their curiosity, open-minded culture
    - on my second assigment, though I shared all nosql learning with larger vendor-centric-team, accidentally I trained 1 vendor-partner on lot of hashing and low-level techniques assuming him to be 3 to 4 years. It was after a month or so that I realized that he had only 5 to 6 months of experencice. He was damn good at figuring out a low-level shall-cloning bug which I was struggling to figure out

## Autonomy-on-problem-solving over designation,Position,money
- If you have top 3 problems and you care about outcome,result than routine process below might help
    - autonomy to form a small team of my own would be a great help 
    - In my view and experience  team with good matching frequency and autonomy(tools,techniques,time-mgmt) does a lot more than expected and as lead or team-member I ensure or contribute to the best of my knowledge
- normally in big organizations, the buhorizontal-ride
- vertical-ride

## Recuriter HR

## CXO
- I will consider lucky if I you are looking at my profile
- leaving other Xs, assuming you are CTO, CDO, CIO
- i have only few things to sell you to the best of my current knowledge
- i can store data as cheap as $23 per tb leveraging aws-s3 or eqvt store
- I could think of process and come with a serveless model with 10gb (10 to 80 million records) with stipulated time of 15min window
- I could help in a scalable-model leveraging partitioning on data with core-domain attributes like product, customer and go further down with sub-domain and crafting with custom-tailored-solution
- Could also help in vertical-wide, evolvable-architecture with good design-options 
- you need to form a team internal, external to solve the problem with out-of-the-box thinking for a novel-business-problem

## Architect 
- You could be a solution-architect, system-wide-archiect, data-architect, xyz-architect , accidental(like-me-in-wipro)
- You can expect below from me.
    - my strength is really on applying domain-driven-design, doing trade-off analysis, documenting architectural decisions, design options for novel-business-problems
    - In my view buisness-flow, data-flow diagrams are more important than general clould providers reference architecture. 
    - i generally put the busines-domain-langugae to be centric and ubiquitious, so runtime infra is low preference.
    - I usually draw plain diagrams  which caters larger-stakeholders like (PO, FO, BA,developers) so that we all speak same language and simplify the problem in first-hand. Next explore some new busines-capabilities.
    - i strongly believe core functionality to work smoother, accurate on aggregations, so its important we are clear with core problem.
    - once we are thorough, of course we can  now look a scalability leveraging domain-attributes. 
    - I usually believ in crafting custom-tailored-solution constrained to the actual-problem-space
    - I love taking to all stakeholder from developer to all way from business-stakeholders, I do respect all. 
    - I generally present 2 or 3 design option allow stakeholders to choose interms of cost-constraints like money, developemnt, opportunity etc
    - this might be further helpful

        - [Why do I step into your shoes](#why-do-i-step-into-your-shoes)
        - [One Reason To Work With Me](#one-reason-to-work-with-me)
- I am usually bad at below, considerations of mine for you to tradeoff
    - I usually dont have a generic-architecture that I could readily apply, unless the domain-problem is very static in nature.
    - Please excuse me, if I dont have a general cloud-providers infra reference architecture diagram.
    - Also, I am not really good at building brand new CICD pipelines, I usually try some  existing one, figure out alternatives till the feature shapes up well, I usually automate this at end
    - Though, I have some interest in SRE and operational stuff, until business problem demands it, I stay away from over-engineering on SRE the business-attributes should exhibit this behavior
    - if applications are not-internet facing,  I usually  dont emphasize too much metics like junit, sonar, sast,cast, monitoring(new-relic) tool as they often dont get the context of problem, mostly they have false positives, though configuring them is no harm and potentially serve as a good checklist.



## Why do I step into your shoes
- I attempt to know the problem from  your point of view
- some rationale of my  biggest fears you need to know
    - if i/we have misunderstood requirement as whole
    - if there were will be change in requirement which need to be factored
    - do we have wholistic view of problem
    - what are the unknowns i/we need to know
    - if the current tool/technology/solution is optimal enough, cheap enough etc
    - will it bring change in the software design
    - u  are not telling me that new  customer to be added, not sure how long will it take to incorporate
    - not sure if the current tool/applicaiton/feature will be retired/replatformed with new one
-  occasionaly it might appear as if im stepping into your shoes/role, it could be becuase of myrole(could be informal) on an ideology of https://architectelevator.com/ my assignment is usually very short one 6 months. some one has to ride the elevator connecting all stakeholders as gregor mentions, nothing is stopping us to rotate by 90 and imagine left to rides as tram/cable-car which goes from left-to-right or vice versa. this horizontal/cascade ride is very true when we talk on lot of upstream or downstream connected systems/applications

## Business Decision Maker
- You could be PO, FO, executive, director, VP ...xyz 
- Love to talk to you, whats on your mind, how you want me to help
- what data points, you need

## Product Owner
- based on my own experience, POs as oppososed to have total ownership(domain,technical,operational-stuff),  play a mix of roles (mgmt,point-of-contact, delegator-to-(technical-team, QA, BA etc) ) 
- my last company had only 13 product lines, but hundres of POs, so thats where my difference of opinion comes from.
- if you could help me on what you would like to own and your expectations from my side we could have less friction and put our business goal than occasional-namesake-roles
- below is how I could help, clarify
- Fact : mostly I have solved several problems in last 10+ years of 18 year IT career not because of technical(breadth + depth) but puerly undestanding functional-domain-knowledge(mostly breadth, ecosystem, business-flow,data-flow etc )  becuase  I leverage on [domain-driven-design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) 
- optimisitically in my opinion I think a domain-expert-panel(PO,funcitionalowner,BA) should screen the 1st or 2nd round of interview-if-external, if interal-assignment(alteast do a litmus test, unless PO is playing a pure-people-leader-mgmt or forced to do so). atleast you could devise the system problem in a ciphered manner and see if the candiate/new-member(someone like me ) could solve the actual problem, worst-case atleast you get a fair idea on solution cost(development,opportunity,money($,inr,euro )
- ok we have no choice but to work together, here is further, how we can help each other
- whats the core features of the app/system
- what are the top 3 bizness problems you think we should solve for next 6 months or for a year.
- is there any feature in your mind which you think it of greater value that top 3, but you didnt get anyone help from technical-feasability side.
- rather than adding features, you think stabilization is of prime importance.
- no matter what we pick we will together agree and tradeoff something.

- please dont hestiate give feedback, once in a month or so, becuse typically i take projects for 6 months or so.
-  occasionaly it might appear as if im stepping into your shoes/role, it could be becuase of myrole(could be informal) on an ideology of https://architectelevator.com/ my assignment is usually very short one 6 months
- [Why do I step into your shoes](#why-do-i-step-into-your-shoes)
        
## Functional Owner
- not every company has it, but when they have, probably its best consider below
- breadth of functional-domain
- end-user, customers pain-points, re-negotiate on demo-feedback, development-cost
- occasionaly discuss on new buiness capabilities (any one  could also do, but I feet this person is best negoitator along with PO )
- not all features, enhancement are worth, after careful data-points,impact of (1end user vs larger-audience) so push-back with you could help us.
- if you are new like me please involve me in stakeholder discussion, or give me a summmary so that I could help better later
- irrespeciive of my designation, you could treat me as a problem-solver who like brainstorming for new ideas or studid ideas
- any feedback anytime is welcome, please check on my assigment-duration with my reporting mgr, so that u could plan a important delivery.

## Business Analyst
- here's 
- if there's one role i have benefitted in solving many hard problems is on clarity Business Analysts /FOs
- if you know sql, you could pull out the data from database, that's excellent for us to further simplify the requirement
- if you dont have sql knowledge, no problem, we could pull out the data into excel or any spreadsheet which you are comfortable, we could simplify from there, 
- typically we could be undestanding bread and depth of dataflow,
    - if analytics then do aggregation, rollup strategy  on either production-or-near equivalent data proabably masked with cutomer data
    - if data not available, we could brainstorm on the core domain attributes, and ourself project a data volume growth, and validate our few theories
- oh, you have an excellent idea which is benefetial to business ,but so far nobody entertained from technical-team, yes we could discuss, if my role allows i will try to ride up that idea to upper stakeholders to bottom developers
- [Why do I step into your shoes](#why-do-i-step-into-your-shoes) 

## Backend Developer/Engineer
- hmm irrespective of my designation, i always love coding, designing, evaluating tradeoffs
- I am one of you on git.
- first thing I like is working people smarter than me, so I could be very dumb(domain, familarity)  as your are expert in  the current project, so please expect lot of stupid questions and bare me for few weeks, till I get a good grip on understanding the problem-domain, feature, rationale for current design & tech-stack etc 
- if you are new like me, we are in same boat, we will sail together unless there is a big hole(wrong domain, wrong technology) to sink
- it would be great if could know your availablity, tech-stack, functional-domain-knowledge etc
- Togther we will be heavily collaborating on  git, confluence, though i usually prefer java,sql for complex problems, as long as business requirement is met  with 90% of inteded business-use-cases ask BUC, you could pick your own languge, design, deployment tool
- mostly I dont do  peer code-review, due to lack of  grip on the business-domain, sometime its too obvious.
- please try to summarize the domain,context for which the code change was made, so that we can together see if this code change, breaks any business-flow, data-flow etc.
- however if you request me because for some rationale like you could break the existing business flow, you dont understand the domain, you encountered heavy bugs offlate and you broke somthing u need another pair of eyes. based on the complexity we will set aside some dedicated time and will together approach.
-  if its a scalbility-problem, data-intensive-compuation, major-security-concern I would do a peer review
-  in my view, business-purpose for what we changed the code is most critical thing, so lets document either in code itself, confluence etc
- most importantly we will come up with multiple design-options with cost(development,tradeoffs,timelines, buffer) together we will give present it back and ask decision-maker-of-buisness to choose and we execute according to the plan
    - remember we will try figure out a least-worst-design as opposed to best-design(becuase it keeps changig every year)
    - if there is not much change in business, we dont need heavy design either whatever 1st desing works could be deployed asap, thats the best we could do
    - we could be refactoring (applying martin-flowers techniques) on critical-domain-areas
- just 1 thing if you are too much excited about a technology, we will first try on least-impacted business-domain, test it for few months and then apply slowly in critical-areas.
        - 
## Frontend Developer/Engineer
    - Though,I dont have, much grip on frontend technologies, I do care for responsiveness like SLA of overall Page in 2 to 5 seconds, though this varies from domain to domain, will see what I can help, 
    - from backend anything like a dynamic 2d api with headers and attributes is totaly feasible solution to reduce your all developemnt activities
    - generally, I look at reducing number of clicks, elminating some user entry inputs from small controls to whole screen if it makes sense to automate
    - its also worth to know that, we could reduce the network-rountrips, overall input exchange between front-end and backend and together we can stratgize this, historically, we have solved in past by using database and service layer to to the best of knowledge.
    - on a side note we will try to make the layout as adaptive as possible than absloute positioning

## Work-Experiences
## Company-1-Tomax Jun-2005 to Sep-2009
- Tomax India,Bangalore 
- Domain : Retail
- Exposure on inventory-mgmt, workflow-mgmt, 
- tenure 4.3 years, taste of good-developer caring-for-performance, building-reusable components for desktop-applications,
- interview(process) 
- round-1 a set of multiple choice questions, 
- round-2(a coding on paper), 
- round-3 mgr+hr 
- in the coding round i was asked to build a floyd's trinangle which i had never heard of early, my-interviewer gave me hint that it was right triangle of * incrementing by one on each line, having some grip on for loops , I gave few attempts with 2 nested for loops, i was almost giving up , inteviewer said you are almost there with logic.
when i went out from room. my friends from NIIT-java-training institute said what took you so long, it was 45 mins. we all had 20 min to 30 mins max. as we were waiting for the shortlisting, i knew i performed bad, but gave a thought that if selected, i will anwser boldly, confidently for 1 reason ( I wanted to work with the interviewing person), that was the impact he had created. Yes i was seleted, for next round, anwsered few things on socket,api, hobbies etc, joined tomax on 6th june 2005.
An insight for you, if i like the inteviewing person (wisdom,patience,openess,smarter than me), i like to perform better and have inclination of joining the company, trading off on my expected-CTC
- 6-months-traning 
- initally I was in a training of 6 months, re-trained on java,sql, dbms concepts, html,javascript.
- we also received some good session on retail product as well.
we were four peope from NIIT(different branches), and from tomax there were four dedicated mentors for us, later there were .
Parallely we were tasked to build a software library for the company. Though initially were bit of competing coming from different regions,states,languages culture, we slowly adopted  towards just 1 goal building the library our goal to the best of our knowledge making more useful for company users.
occassion we gave test 1 in each month, for 3 times i recall.
This was foundational for strenghting in my OOP concepts, java, multithreading concepts also how to work in collaboration. also a little on my leading and presentation skills 
- real-projects
- when I first got into a project, i was tasked to do testing for 3 weeks or so, i was little skeptical as i wanted to start on development, coding-stuff, i did research on wiki narrowed that boundary testing is what testers fail from database,  having looked at database constraints i was able create few bugs in Jira to everyones surprise. later i got to know that that the  scenario(business-flow) never happens. 
- next i was tasked to build a inventory lookup screen using java swing desktop library, it went for several weeks to shape it up, wrote thousands of lines, mostly fear of bug, wrote lot of defensive code on 1 side, embedded lot of flexibilty for user to search with anything like substring, comination of domain-fiels like item, category backed by sql or operator, and wild card of sql like , and few java-layer, i introduced lot of configurations for explicitly controlling the behaviour,
Though i delayed my work for few weeks got support from my team lead, after i expalined all what i was trying to embed, there were few bugs and the search screen was well received, i got some fame from it as well, 
though i was little skpetical on working java swing building graphical components, its my team lead/mentor who encouraged that its a good way to start the career.
Takeway was i was becoming very good on layout managment with adaptive behviours, especially using gridbaglayout manager, because it had weights to strech a component in both horizontal and vertical dimension.
Till date i leverage this techniue on several ways, yes it as something to do with even LLMs 2B,70B models as well in my view.
I also got expertize on building table, table tree ui components. This helped for almost for next 6 years or so until i completely switched by profile for backend-developer.
All amazing stuff i did was because of math. 
Of course lot goes to on my java OOPs to build reusable components, and few  j2ee patterns but it wasnt visible to everyone, because the frontend work i did overshadowed.
Then i kept on building several screens, reusable components, i got assiged to multiple projects.
slowly though i was famous for front-end developement, i got interset in backend using jdbc, hiberanted, ejbs, servlets, jsps etc they were trending at  that time.
next i got to work on a something called workflow-activity-mgmgt (an workflow-orchestrator in current  terminology), sadly I had to move away from my mentor's direct coaching,
again built several resuable components, got to collaborate with different team-lead they had different ideologies, but I continued with my initial teachings of my mentor. after a year or so this project was called off, we did everything best, amazing stuff, etc but got to hear there end user vision had changed.
Lesson learnt , validate the business requiremnts, so hence forth till date i strongly apply domain-driven-design and validate business-requiment.
Next for a year mid-2008 or so I worked on an unique opportunity CXA customer-experience-architecture for Lesschwab tires.
And they had zeroed o ULC- ultra light client libarry liccensed one cost lakhs at that time.
ULC - purpose rich client application every gui compoent was split into client and server component. Primarily there were two people we had strong grip on building desktop application my mentor and my self. And on US counter part i heard there were two developers leading this whole program (surpisingly they were almost near to 60 years of age.) This was a useful information, i got to learn that i can become a developer till 60 years of my age.
coming back to project, i got training from  my mentor and those two super senior deveopers.
Now i was tasked to train others including my other tech-leads who were leading web development projects.For tomax this was the most visible project, because as opposed to reatial-product they wanted to try services for this 400 store Les-schwab Tires.
Now i was also in limelight, not the technology was hard but i had to train and work with almost 2x to 3x of my experence, I bet on my grip on java, swing libaray concepts, knowledge on ULC trained many for 2 months.
Project started i did something different in execution.
I took lead on few critical component(appointment-schedueler, reusable-table-comonent,reusable-tabletreecomonent), and guided others on their day to day development acitivities. 
parallel i was digesting this CXA technique, a protoype bassed approach you can litterally click all embded dummy screens experience the overall flow an build stuf and adapt based on rapid feedback. this was a phenomenal technique i used for almost all of my front end development, wLater this helped me understand better on api contracts with web-services(SOAP, REST)
of course lot And lot went smooth, Ocassionaly I had guidance from my mentor and other leads when i was getting struck.

Then it was mid-2009, we recived a letter from CEO starting  with "Nothing is permanent in life" ending with we are closing Tomax India operations. More than me, it was shocking for several seniors as probably because of their financial dependency, emotional attachement(including myself).
on sep 15 2009 we all tomax india were happy, because we got almost 4 to 6 months of salary as compenstation based on tenure we served. by the way i got 4 months 
I just said to myself any company i join, i will keep resignation in my pocket and work fearlessly.
i took a break to spend 2 months with my family, went to my native for  a month enjoying food.
Then when i started back, job openning were little less, more screening due to global financial housing bubble impact. finally after with a bit of struggle, with 50% hike i got an offerm from CSC, chennai, i accepted


## Company-2-CSC Dec-2009 to Mar-2016
- computer sciences corporation, now DXC again acquird by HP
- tenure 6 years: attempting to be a good consultant, exploring leadership, collaboration, new challenges in domain of telecom,investment-banking
- interview proces 
- round-1 : 4 people from csc did a rapid fire questioning to test my knowledge, presure-hanling skills on java, swing, servlet, sql etc.
- round-2 : client as panel of 2 (mgr + tech-lead) telephonic in csc bangaore office , repeated more less above, plus mulithreading, and couple of puzzles , i attempted 1 
- Finally hr got over and after disucssing with my mentor, friends, i choose to go chennai.
- ### verizon deputation, chennai (3 years)
- 1st project(vmlite()) and taste of blackberry, being deputed a client-office chennai olympia techpark
- task-1 is a good one to share i was tasked load some static-data to database and devise a solution (automation-script), the static domain was little tricky, so with dedicated week of work i devsied a partial solutiong in java, parsing and reformatting with something like notepad/textpad which i dont recall,
    I loaded all data and went back after a week or so, i had streched late-night to acheieve this.
    one of the expert, saw, verified the work and said good work.
    till then, intersitingly every day afternoon my other CSC colleague used to send a mail stating i will be late.
    It was larger audience in the mail chain.
    My client manager, seeing that work was completed faster than his anticipation, relaxed me coming late to office. And asked my colleague not to send my late coming mail. 
- then it went on bug fixing, feature enchancements, i became approachble on blackberry front end developer.
- the blackberry application was primarily targed for verizon field technician for data to day work, backed by scheduling, job assignment etc.
- then after few months almost a year, there came a requirement(vmobile), an important one to me.
    The requirement was to build a laptop desktop application, probably few fields technicians were getting/promoted to use laptops for their work. So they wanted to resuse the existing business domain logic and build a a new application which was almost similar/tobe-faimilar wth blackberry application.
    I was a natural pick, with Swing in my expericence, now the cxa les-schwab experience came to help me I proposed we should be building adaptive screens, and we could incorporate little extra developemnt time for building resualble table component promising reduction of future developemnt.
    it was a bit to struggle to convince the stakeholders . 
    Luckily my csc-colleague (now my long term friend) had prior experience in verizon and quite reputation. so he convinced on our ideas. while was leading on the front-end technology, te took care of back-nuiances like a soap webservice, polling etc. and he taught few of this.
    eventually with few demos and promise of new capablities, slowly it got statbilized. and after few months of production, we got to hear that its lot easier for field technician on laptop then blackberry due to screen size and extra capablities which we had introduced.
    Lesson learnt, you need a strong ally(my-Csc-colleague, client-mgr, client-team-lead), to make sure our ideas work.
    once stabilized, i requested to move away from this project and i was assigned back to blackberry application projet
- then it was bug-fixing, few enhancements
- one intersting small feature was to share the location silently every time he/she/x picked a job, status-update, reroute, etc i implemented using a timer logic with explicit control on timer settings etc.
- - verizon by this time had already checked my interest if would like to join their org
    - i rejected 1st time because they offered mgmt position, with just 6years i felt its too early and conveyed i am only intersetd in technical stuff.
    - second time i rejected as family settled in banglaore, though reapproached on technhical stuff, 
    - on a side note same was offered to my-csc-colleague.
- @ 2012 a parallel developement, i met my life parterner as verizon-employee, we chose to go back to banglore by end of 2012 towards over hyped dooms day.

- CSC was courteous to find project for me in bangalore, on myrequest
- visa, banglore (2 months)
- inteviewed for an hour or so, the person who was inteviewing(telephone) i never met
- intially i was screened for technical stuff, and later they wanted to put me on L3 support work, which i declined
- i was released to bench thats what they call back then, CSC looking at my past experience, with in a week helped me to sceened at Societe Generalle
- on a side note there were some credit card processing domain session by an excellent BusinessAnalyst, that was helpful
- Societe Generalle -investment banking (3 years)
- interveiw process (1 round of technical discussion), the inteviewer was very polite and was screening on culture and proessure handling stuff
- project-1 (referential repository)
    - a very good team lead, super BA, QA and excellent team members, i never felt like a consultant
    - unlike verizon, all meeting in Societe Generalle were open for everybody, there is no close talk/discussion separately with SocGen employees , we were allowed in all team lunch, parties, outings etc.
        what an amazing culture, almost zero bias
    - when it comes to culture, socgen comes first in my mind
    - the purpose of application was to consoldiate all the stocks/instrumens data and treat as golden copy for downstreams. they used an asset mgmt tool proprietary. backed by tibco rv messaging, 
    - i did some bug fixing, enhancements on message filtering, did ant to maven migration(1000 of scripts floating) did some bash scripting to automate work, had to incorporate/inject backward compatiblity  stuff like that.
    - on a side note our client team lead ensure that we all go around 4 evening for a tea-break and no technical discussion. that was a good culture.
    - again i was offered couple of times on my willingness to join socgen, though the culture was superb, probably i could have a got a fat pkg, if felt tech to be outdated, glad i did it,  i declined stating i had different technical aspirations
    - i conveyed the same to CSC and  CSC got me to another project for another vertical
- project-2(securities-book-keeping) tast of web-api development
    - interviewed(1 round of technical discussion) it was mostly a open discussion on current-problems, team capabilities etc, i showed by interest.
    - it was mostly a upgradation of an existing tool with latest technogies.
    - we were 4 members from CSC and 3 from Socgen including team lead
    - we did some enchancements, I trouble shooted few exising, creeping issues, primarily on performance.
    - i guided team on front end developement, though i restrained taking active development on front end
    - there came a requirement of building servcies for seurities based geography reconciling the position/movements for each trade done.
        i volunteered for this and started building soap webservices, built an aggregation logic purely based on java hashing technique, for consolidating all movements for a given instrument and region
        parallely i was working a lot with 2 BAs who extensive knowledge and were open enough to simplify the domain of how trades happen. one of them prepared an excel , priortized the use case, i kept on building stuff as per his instructions, correcting my aggregation logic , we even tested for a scale of few  thousands , which BA tested. These two BAs were from France, so i got to know lot of their culture.
        all went well we deployed and end user were happy with consistency of aggragation logic. They dont accept even 1 decimal variation, yes we need. of course the performance was also good.
        After stablizing i thought of moving out from CSC, primarily for a market correction 
    - post my resignation, the client manager did propose on offering a position, i was skeptical  as i had some other technical apirations.
        parallel CSC also didnt want to leave, so they offered csc-france for the same project, middel-east on site. The france onsite offer from csc didnt materialzie and others i declined.
    - on a side note finally working for 3 years, i got convinced that stock market is trustable and  i can also invest. So its a life time lesson added for my financial-goal, this domain has helped me on personal goal.
    - i dont mind now joining back to this domain any time, as long as the i culturally fit them well.
## Company-3-Wipro Apr-2016 Jul-2018
- i thought of 2 months break, and passively applied job, got an offer from wipro-weekend drive.
- parallely i was also interviewed by HCL, again for a constutant position for caterplillar
- interview process(panel 4 gave different situations )
- inteview process(1 technical discussion all-conceptual) the interviewer was impressed with my fundaamentals i believe followd by hr round , got an offer, i chose to accept
- project-1 (Ericsson telecom)
- unlike my onsite client deputation , this was in wipro office (1 year electornic city, another year in divaysthree tech park, white field)
- frankly speaking this my firs exposure to service-based consultancy services , from office , canteen, campus etc
- it was very unique experience on campus, culture
- purpose of appication: a central library for all 50 plus hosted OSS aplications to talk to database(object oriented database(versant)), it  had abstraction for below
    -  2-phase-commit transaction 
    -  a primary publisher to event-channel
    - Some OSS configurations, adaters(MIB,RAN) etc
    - built on top RMI, CORBA for few appoications
- when i looked a source code of projects and inception date it dated back to 2006, i could literally see GOF patterns, few J2EE patterns, it was built very beautifully with separation of concerns with just plain java classes and structures.
- The team was good, our scrum-master cum manager called BABA protected us from unnecessary issues, I also got work with a colleague-1 a domain expert on telecom with a decade expericence, he always had an idelology to fail-fast and fail intelligently, may be becasuse of the issues seen around. 
there as another colleague-2(now a long term friend) who coulple of year experience had solid exposure in administration of versant databse and shell scripts and he was really good at articualting things to customer.
Primarily we 3 as an ally guarded the fort of CS libary from all the issues/ 50 plus applications we could literally get ticket from any where, any team. There was this ball-game of its not our issue war, 
No wonder  i got  introduced into a concept of rooster-call on-call-support for weedends. This was the reason i got my first laptop.
    Till then i was only working on desktops.
- Though designated as architect in wipro coming back to my contribution my first  recognition / reputation didnt come for solving/troubleshooting issue, but ti  was for improving a consisteny-check-tool(usually-took-50 mins) which i improvised(reduced 12 to 15mins) by recuding system-calls, networks-calls, io-calls. probably my colleague-1 wanted to check my strenghts 
- after couple of months i realized  that designation was namesake and i was lead developer in role in practice.
- the frequent issue , when the ticket was raised  was cs library has locked the transaction, we need their support, it was optimistic locking strategy which every application could have chosen when they connect to CS libary, but they needed our help to show that, since two application concurrent behaviour for data-integrity lock could have occurred, there was blame game for lack of knowledge stating application A, B...X caused it etc,
most of the time my-allyteam(myself,colleague-1,colleague-2) we suggested you just suggested you retrigger your usecase because thats what is needed to do, some teams were adomant(stated) to give full explanation, so we took the global event-channel log it gave applications A,B,..x who caused, the sharded resource(object) on versant-database etc they never came back after that mail,ticket comments not sure what they understood.
since I was a new commer my colleague-1 and 2 did many times articulation because i spoke too much technical digging into versant database source occassionally, JTA etc give clarity.
- there was 1 one more ticke of special interset , some application team came and said that CS libary the comment section of resource(RAN,WRAN,MIB etc) is limited and we could enhance it to be unbounded length. I was just thinking did he mean ram size or hard disk size. my colleague-1 said to take a look, i said we could go max ram size or the string's size not beyond that. He said please gather some proof for your statement then i researched at both jvm and Javalanguagespec. then recalled java-source code String class and its length method backed by char[].lenth, gave proof that that max, gave apporximat 2^32 -1 . My colleague-1 took this info and handled ticket on this own taking out the complexity which the application team x had raised.
- there were few more enhancements which i did, if i recollect will add later
- a very seriously annoying thing for every release made was something call ST-KPI, it was metric to measure if there was delta in performance between (previous, current), thats a big story, if performance impoved/degrade we had to findout root-cause, not sure who devised but they did forget the jdk upgrade, ant/maven upgrade, os changes, database upgrade etc, it was a big mess all together finally someone top all way to ericsson client made a decision which benchmark to be taken going forward which i never got visibility.
- on fun side post lunch we had a good team of 7 to 8 people , though not directly connected on work, but belonging to same restricted area, we enjoyed food, conversations, gossips and a 15 to 20 min walk.
- finally mid 2018 i decided to move on, having some experiences, with stong will power i repeatedly said to my self to join a product based company and ok to take a break for 2 t 3 months.
- on a side note 
    - i didnt work with any ericsson mgmt directly , nor  i was approached by ericsson account to be aborbed
        however based on work tipped off from a very senior colleague which i wasnt aware, i was projected for Huwaei account, after my resignation,   the client was intersted, interveiwed(TPS problem with an aggregation locid was a intersting one  and i still recall most of the discussion , as it was mostly mathematical. )
        Though technically it sounded good, it didnt materialize and more over  usually its not good to negotiate once I resign from my position , so declined that offer from wipro's attempt to retain me.
- left wipro on 11 july 2018, with a cake celebration(first one for me on leaving company)
## Company-4-GE Oct-2018 Jan-2024
-  5.3 years - discovering myself as software-engineer, system-designer, architect
- 
    - by oct 1st i had two offers 1 from GE, 1 from Quest
    - quest
        - i even went to  quest for 2 days, becuse GE HR round was pending, on second day of quest, in mid onboarding of Quest i had GE HR round, and from my ge hiring manger got a call stating that i went through it but hike would be 10% only as suggested earlier by him. next day i sent my resignation to Quest, and couriered their access badge etc.
        - fin
    - inteview-process
        - i had just finished my HR round from Quest, as per schedule reached GE prestige shantiniketan bangalore
        - the hiring manager introduced the panel of two (archiect,staff engineer)  at 2 pm
        - this will be a lengthy, as it reflects the way i could be interviewed hence  forth
        - round-1
            - i was asked to design a stock-market trading application and was contrainted to meet SLA of a < 1second
                - i started explaing the http 2 conectpts which i had recently researched on multiplexing, bidirectional concelpts, i just ruled out synchrous tcp/ip on my design, did few more thinks like handling asyn communiations etc.
                - was asked to draw a sequence-diagram, i had use stuff like that quite some time back, so i did all diagramming with flow-chart, data-flow etc on whiteboard
            - i was also asked to qucikly explain some design conceps for building facebook/linkedin, ofcouse i was struggling to design the concepts because i didnt use either practically, though i had some graph linking in my mind, the panel gave some tips on many-to-many scenario.
            - by this time more than a hour had passed, the staff panel left for a meeting
        - round-2
            - the architect gave a coding round to design a computing algorithm for all part of a GE engine, he said the could be thousand of parts. and we could be using it for more than 1 engine, now scale was hundreds of thousand parts.left me in the room and went for meeting
            - having some good grip on building table tree components in my first company I kind of leveraged that concpet
            - i wrote  a custom java data-strucure list<nodes>, with a node parent, details of the part, used equals, hash code check check for engine and part equality.
            - built a rollup strategy as parts got added, using mutationn, making some thread safety partitioning by engine,part-name comibnation as key strategy.
            - some of the edge cases were not possible.
            - afer more than a hour the inteveiwing-architect came back and took the papers  i wrote, he asked few more scenarios i gave some explanantions
            - i was told to wait it was almost 7 to 7 30 pm, the hiring-manager came and said he had a meeting and will come back later, please wait we will finish today itself.
            - finally around 8 he came back as opposed to discussing in meeting room, we went for a stroll, on prestige shantiniketan campus, it was quite big.
             he asked how i felt about that technical discussions,  i just said it was good for me , system design, i tride my best. he asked why i have 2 months gap, why i quit wipro in just 2 years, i said my interest joing the right company and challenging work, He was direct and asked will you leave ge after 2 years if the project is not challenging, i had no fear, having some mixed opinion on wipro-culture, i instantly said yes i will quit if dont get challenging work. he asked my expectation on CTC. 
             so far this was the best interview rounds, so i said i am ready to negotiate on CTC if the work u offer is challenging and you promise to take care of correction in future.
             he said let HR round get over we can discuss post that.
        - round-3 HR
            - the HR Was repeatedly asking the reason to live wipro, he was convinced by my gap post wipro for 2 months,
            - then asked why i want to join, i gave some reasons of my interest towards ge based on Ge Healtcare interview process, i hadnt cleared 2 years back, so i am trying for now.
            - he took my expectations, when i can join etc
        - finally i got from ge-recruiter(very-nice-person who was co orginating professional). that i have cleared HR round, hiring manager will back to me,
        - same day hiring-mangaer called and said if you are ok with 10 to 15 % Ge is willing to rollout, for GEs reputation i aceepted.
    - Ge aviation domain
        - the way i have understood,the space i got exposed to,  everything in GE stars with an engine coming to shop visit,then many many appliations digitize  on the overhaul repair,replacement of parts etc .
            every year for a  pre-selected quarter of a year they check if the margin they signed with customer to see if margin signed for 5 to 20+ year is profitable or not, so that hey can make some adjustment on overhaul for next year repair vs replacement of part (old,new) 
                customer(
                        airline like tata,indigo,southwest
                        airfame boeing,airbus
                        ), 
            - on  a side note GE is very strict process oriented, strong cultured on ethics
    - project-1 (workflow-orchestrator)
        - my intro to microsevices, spring-boot, aws-cloud, cicd-pipeline, aviation-domain
        - having a strong grip on servlet, soap-webservice,  I discovered these are new replaced with @restcontroller
        - i had visiblty to machine hosted where the service ran,
        - i had visibility to machine which hosted database
        - jdbc DAO, DTO was replaced by JPA @respository and @JDBCTemplate
        - the visiblity to cloud gave clear cut idea that we can leverage cpu GHz, ram-memory 4 to 8gb , started making several attempts to leverage on these concepts for every service request.
        - also i was new to Git and github so the my initial colleagu-1,colleague-2 helped me to configure this for me.
        - culture and team orgzn
            in ge based on project u work, the team has parterner ship with vendors could be %(50 + 50) or (30%ge+70%vendors(tcs, capegemini,genpact(BAs))). So far  i was working as consultant for almost 8 years and now I had to work with consultant inverse of what i had done.
            Though there was not strict timing, the team followed agile practices, the team size was close to 15 members,  i think so. 
            2-qa(akhay,pooja-b), 
            1 ba, 
            1 vendor-architect, 
            1 data-modeler-cum-dba- 
            1 PO, 
            2 FO
            1-pod-lead, 
            7-backend-developers(myself+3ge(surjot,malpani,pooja)+2vendor(k))
            3-front-end( 2 ge(vishnu,abhinav)+vendor) vishnu,harshalli
            after i joined in couple of months atleast 4 people got dropped off. by the end of 2 plus years, the team size got reduced to 7 member (vishnu,kalyan,akshay,gautham,po,ba,fo)
        - purpose   
            - before this tool, there was a tool where all cmr users uploaded their documents to a box folder, whicn can shared and collaborated. so this tool was primarliy targeted to automate that in cloud.
            The original desinger, authors made a good choice of leveraging Elasticfilesotrage service from aws, though several times i visualized it to be a s3 bucket. after I left this change was done.
            - another purpose was to automate close to 80 cmr steps , these belong to variouse modeling needs like technical, financiail, cost etc
        - first weeks like my 1st company, came  with testing the application from my POD-lead(team-lead), then analyzing few requirements on feasiblity though i proposed few solutions, i heard the application would crash if he fulfilled the requirements so didnt materialize, then came some minor enhancements and bugs in existing application.
        one bug got my attention because nobody wanted to touch it, there was requirement to capture all the activities user did on the overall workflow which was captured en events table, only top 20 or 30 were shown on the screen, yet the events table which kept on growing day by day connected with some important tables, and each time some one went to activities screen, it took 7 to 8 mins to load for couple of scenario, occassionaly that particular microservice failed, crashed . team just restarted the microservice manually by running a chef script. after careful observations i applied a fix by some removing nester query joins and co-relation and even moved fetching a a set of records and its aggregation logic to service layer from database logic. Now it just took few seconds (i guess < 10 seconds). I got some attention from my backend developers team.
        -  my 1st major deliverable came after almost 2 months of joining , so this was tool had only 1 integration for a contract setup for financial-modeling, now with intent of central orchestartor as visioned by people who built and envisioned this tool, the 2nd integration came  to make an integration with a downstream (technical-modeling) on which requirement kept changing for next 6 months or so. It was also a request from pod-lead, director to lead the design, developement, they were anticipating some future changes heavy in this.
        with help of my colleagues-ge barely 1.5 years of IT expeerince, a qa-ge  i formed an informal team for my developemnt.
            colleague-1 : had an excellent mindset of solving business-problem and a performance-oreiented getting job done attitued
            colleague-2 : was very passionate on technology he used.
            qa : he had a great sense of humor, was super fast on manual testing, was primarily an automation tester, complementing other qa person who did manual testing.
        all a good grip on domain especiall my colleague-1 was my goto person to understand the business problem
        parallel there was lot of discusions happening on integrations, business use case from PO to PO , BA to BA conversations. I made 1 thing very clear to keep design simple, stupid, extensible and flexible. Because the discussion suggested lot of unknowns, some future changes, also political-conflicts for uknown-reasons to me
        Being prouduer of the data, upstream. I did 2 things 
        1. I devised api contract codes for each of the business use case. - froze on contract code but gave option for extensibity by adding new codes
        2. Rather, tightly coupling designing for java objects , i choose to parse the json payload, got some dirty pollutiong of code, but it was quick to make any change for  downstream application request.
            - before I left the project, i converted back to java objects for other readability.
        both helped to have a good control and i could litterally make change as soon as I heard change in requirement and do a git push, for qa testing.
        Ofcourse due to json complexity I had to do the whole development, later did KT and my team appreaciated point-1.
        almost 5 months passed, for having nearly less bugs, doing quick evolving changes, I came to notice of POs, In my team the POs got changed twice and we got a new PO
        I stopped actively taking developments it was well stabilized.
        - parallely on technical front, i was updating several things
            -  i got trainings AWS, aviation domain.
                - more than aws the avaiation-domain helped me to solve lot of future domain-problems
            - aws visiblity of resources was forcing me to think on efficient utlization below 
                compute -  2 to 4 gb ram compute, 
                storage-db -  the data growth of appliation 32 MB by the time i left i might have touched 100mb or so
                storage-efs - for storing all documents, since it was elasic, never bothered but felt s3 to be a good fit
            - microservices - good design
                spreaded across 8 to 9 microsercies
                - only 3 meant solving domain problem, rest 5 felt more of libary, shared service dilemma
                - 12 factor app     
            - cicd 
                colleague-3(the architect-3 who interviewed)
                was helping me to understand the aws resources, chef-script, helping me to get some IAM permission
            - I was nominated for 2-days [GIDS conference](https://developersummit.com/),bangalore
                - sessions from neal-ford, mark richards, scott davis and few other changed changed my approach on microservices design, architecture, domain-driven-desing, front-end tricks etc
                - i applied several techniques from these , discarded some concepts of 12-factor heroku apporach
                - some techniques like jdbc over hibernate, domain-driven-desing  were not new to me, however hearing from expert boosed on my confidence  in that direction.
                - I was able to build stuff with confidence, talked/advocated in my team on tradeoffs etc
                - from here on wards, i made attempt to attend every year( i even said to my director, to nominate me every year for this)
            - comping back to  my next assignments, few requirements came.
                1.  was a KPI  to capture some 36 months for data for few parameters/factors
                    my colleague1, collegue-2 had a good grip on domain, so  I just guided them on design and advocated on JDBC batch processing with an diffrent approach to store 2d array. 
                    also in our brainstorming we projected the data volume growth for 10 plus years, this helped in giving clear directions to stakeholders.
                    its here where i had discussion with funtionalOwner-1 for brainstorming on requrirements. I suggested to store the data for long term which she liked. the best thing her docucument with BA was very clear, we didnt had to stuggle on understanding the requirements. 
                2. next i took the lead of an new-integration due its criticallity, same old deviced contract codes, etc however took a math apporach to store plain numbers for the domain terms (lock(100),unlock(-100)signoff(200),re-approval(-200)), just a tiny math, but helped for reconciliation and backward compatiblity, aggragation in later. the purpose was simply to have a governance to approve a set of users to to agree if overall business for the given contract can finalized to close for the financial year. 
                Prallely my POD lead had move out of our organizatin. Now there was no replacement, had I to handle few mangeent activies, though I was offered for the POD lead position, being skeptical of mgmt chaos I rejected, however unofficial i became point of contact for the team, apart from from PO.
                3. next guided the team on  design for a feature (probably idea of 1 or 2 users) to introduce a interim iteration/workflow-setup, almost 8 weeks of effort, post-deployment to production, due to a change of mgmt, we were asked to take it out. we just applied a hack to turn off the feature.
                4. Again guided a team on security vulnearablty to securely upload files, apply few defens of depth strategies like file extension, exploding archive and verifying contents etc.
                5. the nextgen technical-modeling hype kickstarted, along with pandemic. i was pulled in for several endless discussion on integration. the first integration was supposed to be replaced by a new tool. fortunately we got a  new POD lead(colleague-4), I was able to focus on my technical stuff.
                colleague-4 was a very systematic planner, in all his activities. 
                6. by this time i had already expressed with my lead and director to move away from this project and to take up an new challenge. I was requested to complete the next-gen integration and promised for next one, 
                we had two major features at our hand 
                1. Problem-1 : To standardize the workflow setup
                2. Problem-2 : the design, develop and  integrate for new integration tool
                parallely, my lead was smart enough to pick the next POD lead. we devised a plan.
                for the problem i just guided the team team on design, this came with lot discussion with biz stakeholder FO,PO 
                for Probelem-2, i played an IC role,from lengthy discussions, to develop and implement with all stakeholders. I also got a chance to work with my  along with my colleague-3-architect who interviewed me.
                He had couple of integration strategies sync,async.
                Knowing the application enough, I strongly insisted the synchronous communication (web-api) with KISS.
                we also brainstormed on technology to pick, though I was more inclined toward exiting Java/springboot stack.
                My colleague had visioned serverless in mind. No matter how we implemented it was clear to me that downstream application need to get/pull information needed from our-upstream-application with < 2 to 5 seconds, because downstream had no clue on overall workflow and only it can get from upstream.
                So from serverless point of view, little google on aws-lambda warned on cold-start, so java was out of context(graal vm was in news, but wasnt tested), so he recommended on node.js/typescript. 
                To test in practice, built the simplest, api requirement we noticed the server to be booted in a second or couple. This gave a good confidence that if could server the data pull in millis, then we could meet the SLA of 2 to 5 seconds.
                I built the most complex api query and verified that it took in 700 to 800 milllis. We zeroed on node.js/typscipt. we sucessfully built  apis and overall developemnt in 8 t 9 weeks.
                MY colleague-3-architect contributed on almost all cloud-formation temlates, for aws-lambda. This helped me to focus on solving the overall business problem in a better way.
                production went smooth, in fact we deployed 1 day prior itself.
                 It was a good learning from me, as well. we presented the the solution to larger audience, also noticed that serverless with integration was something we tried newly in much wider space of the org.
                on a side note, to keep the integration extensible and flexible i leveraged sql view, complex joins and leverageed all buisness logic in it, measuring for an SLA made sense . so the typyescript service layer just handled the error scenarios and was dumb enough on any busincess logic.
                    - on a side note to verify system scalablity, we did a load testing with Jmeter.
                Prallelely, my colleague-4 did a great job on excecution of problem-1.
        
                As i joined new team,   I gave KT  on all that I had gained for few weeks.

    - #### project-2 the modeling problem
        - unlike my previous-team,  This was a vendor-partner heavy team, had their daily scrums in late evenings for on-site PO, BA
        - My previous also also joined this this cost-modeling-space with a manager-role, this was a relief as we had developed a frequency and trust with almost a year or so. He also had a trade-off mindset on timelines of deliverables which was super helpful during execution.
        - first,  we made few corrections like having standup on morning and need basis to connect to PO, BA for clearity on functional and requirements, with little friction eventually everything got settled down.
        - my first task was to analyze a pecular file upload issue which was faling for larger files, after some hiccups i solved by increasing the RAM size, to everyones surprise, others probably didnt notice it. after some math said you could upload upto 2gb for file size, with 10 lakhs per sheet etc which we had discovered.
        - as we were identifying the major problems, were can contribute top 2 things came up
        - Problem-1 : integration strategy for the Next-Gen integration 
        - Problem-2 : a new modeling capability called module-by-workscope which we heard was quite data-centric

        - on few-attempts we wanted first secur the problem-1, as we had observed in the past that the integrations , consume lot of time if potential isssue. As we brainstormed with our vendor-partner who had quite a good grip on the domain, we came to know that existing tool, had direct db-connection to fetch the data the data they wanted. 
        to our surprise the nexgen team which was building a everything on new stack with api-development approach was OK to pull the data directly from the database.
        As we learnt , this was a typical integration everyone followed or dared to question including new NextGen team because the entire cost-space had a common shared-databse architecture and lot of applications 10 plus incluing several modeling, reporting, integration applications were built.
        Having, seen some success on refactoring, I and with few other arcitects and my pod-lead-cum-mgr proposed to build a api wrapper so that the direct db connection, is retired. Our initial idea was simple, with the wrapper to begin, we could have changed the sharded db to service architecture eventually by just satisfying the api contract.
        we proposed a 1.5 to 2 month to develop the solution. we escalated to upper-managment as-well, inspite of presenting all tradeoffs, the downstream stream application didnt even wanted to miss a single day. 
        As we discovered, there also seemed to be some unknown political background for the strong shared db architecture deviation.

        - Now i as tasked to look at Problem-2, with all the inputs from heavy brainstorming sessions strected to 2 to 3 hours occasionaly, learn  that this was serious problem from technical point of view, the team was trying to solve.
        There was a catch in the requirement, for 3 product-lines, the schema could change and was quite dynamic. So they had devised this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93attribute%E2%80%93value_model, which u could take a look in your free time. This was an intersting problem for me as well.
        colleague-5(vendor-partner-1) : very good python, sql, strored-proc and had lot of grip on the cost domain space
        colleague-6(vendor-parter-2) : very tech-centic person, but very cooperative
        BA: was kind enough to simplify the overall the math behind the feature.
        pupose of the feature: to rollup the cost of parts of engine all the way upto an MRO shop and dyanmic parameters like region, thrust etc.
        After few sessions with our BA,  I was able to digest the math and got confidence of solving it.
        on a side-note, Our PO trusted BA who in tern trusted colleague-5,6, so I just made ally with colleague-5,6 and BA.
        But rather than storing the data in the shared database, we started brainstorming on removing the entity-attribute-value pattern, started to look at nosql model, because the acutal million records became 18 million records because there were 18 attributes which got piovted.
        on as side note everyone except me was in team was  talking about reports, there were 4 modeling inputs which they called as reports. It took some time to convince them that they were just modeling inputs. because the end user called it like that. in my view i also reimaning the inputs to be just one, could have syntesized based on a configuration.
        we started thinking of aws mgd servcie leveraging like mongodb. we figured out that getting approval for any new mngd db service could take months of approval.
        in the meanwhile my-colleague-6 was talking about a novel idea of leveraging aws-glue with s3, even had a prototype solution backing his theory. 
        as a backup plan we suggeste colleague -6 and another develoer to continue and proceed with EAV solution.
        We called our nosql solution as option-2.
        Though my I was excited about solving the problem with s3 but was little sketpical about solving it in python ecoysystem which only my colleague-5 had expertise,
        I started ventruing into dumping the dynamic-schema data per product line with java service layer. 
        Also during a brainstorming, it cracked to me to solve in few seconds with max a minute in worst case.
        So far with EAV solution, user could trigger for rollup go for a good walk of 2km or 10 to 15mins coffee breakup for an average usecase. with worst case the team was already concernced with 20 to 25min time. So even they needed a novel solution badly.
        As I started devleoping and implementing the solution it took 4 to 5 weeks extra than as I had anticipated.
        At the background, I conveyed the scalable solution to my manager and he handled it very in background.
        Finally, after few hiccups in correcting the rollup logic,  we took the worst case(20 millions for a product line ) and figured out it took close 10 to 15 seconds for the overall rollup aggregation.
        it had leveraged partitioning on product,customer etc so we confident on scalablity as opposed to eav option-1 on shared-database.
        finally i gave KT, I got over to next project.
        originally i had visioned to work only  6months, however it got strected to 11months
        by the way, after i left  , even though it got prodcutionized after few months, to consumer of it took sweet time and i heard i happend, alost 1 year later.
    - ### project-3 billing reconciliation
        - with intent of getting out solving  in 6 months, with great enthuiasm, solving a no-sql joined this team
        - This team had roughly 50% ge 50% vendor-partner
        - unlike my previous teams, I got saved from NextGen tools jargon, some modeling concepts.
        - This system already had two components
            - app-1.0 an old application which served few cusomter
            - app-2.0 a brand new applicatin with modern tech-stack(java,springboot,vuejs, aws(ECS))
        - purpose - every month GE billed its customer based on an aggrement with something called severity condition in which the engine flew as as opposed orginal agreed severity, Since the contracts were long term ranging from  to 20+ year, biller could charge an explicit dollar escalation
        - this project had already gone with  several iterations, app-2.0 tool promised to be a next-gen tool, heavily betted on aws infra.
        - I was supposed to work on a feature called reconciliation to reconcile billings on qurarterly, semi-annual, annuall and monthly which varide from customer to customer as per agreemet made.
        - in-fact there was ongoing series of design-disucssions, the data-model was finalized, the timelines were alfrady publised sep-end for thie feature.
        - initially i was requested by my pod-lead to just implement it.    
            As I took a look a database ER-diagram several things didnt make sense, looked like the datamodel was merely recopied with just an indicator with regular billing vs reconciled billing. the indicator was flowing everywhere and it looked like stored-proc was the way forward, because the earlier model had built it that way.
            lets call this solution option-1. 
        - as i brought my concerns to my Pod lead and mgr notice, we were trying to re-negotiate with business for 4 months extra.
        - some regural-billing took close to 10 mins.
        - after doing some projection on data volume growth, i made a discovery that if we built with on existing data base the regualar monthly invoicing application and database would also crash. 
            the reason again because of eav pattern for storing severity factors which varied again each customer, contract.
            but unlike my perviouse cost-space-problem which had 20% dynamic attributes play, this had 80% play.
        - more over unlike my previous projects this was portal application facing customer and transaction heavy. 
        - as I discovered there a in impact of $400 million every month.
        - though in theory i wanted by call app-3.0, we thought of applying the solution silently at background. I had a great support from my manager and my director on this.
            we identified  couple of design-options.
                option 2.1 to store 2d array structure for dynamic-severity-conditions - it didnt materalize
                option 2.2 to leverage aws mgd nosql solution, though we were exporling again on mongodb, it didnt materialize.
                option 2.3 leverging aws-s3 got kicked off.
        - due contraints on man-power i got 1 dedicated service developer(colleague-7) added.
        - 1 mistake i did, unlike my previous project where i took only critical flow, i got tagged for entire feature.
            as we discoverd it had some major 7 to 8 flows. ideally i should have only worked flow 4 to 6.
        - couple of months passed, the progress was only upto flow-3.
        - now there was change in mgmt and my QA (colleague-9) was tasked to take up the pod lead role.
        - i was struggling to understand the core functionality and to my surprise this guy had everything what i wanted to tundestand. Though he was scolding me for reaching out later. he was kind enough to simplify all the flows in excel, i was amazed at some math he applied in excel. 
        I said to myself that i need his alliance to solve this big problem. 
        - Things started getting better, With his help we gave buisness also  some new capabilities, by this time the project was already 3 to 4 months delay,
        - as we started brainstorming and simplifying further adding new buisiness capablitiies like file upload, i injected lot of pre-processing techniques (compuations,aggregations) upfront before user could click next. when user went for next step he got already computed results.
        - to remove the eav-pattern, i again leveraged aws-s3 for service layer, with good partition-techniques etc.
        - my POD-lead-cum-QA alredy new how to do load testing , and most of the testing was he did, i just did a sanity y test which saved me.
            - on a side-note i had to make few corrections on the domain of  aggregation-logic, some bugs got surfaced initially for  couple of weeks. then things got better.
            - though there were other testers and BA, i worked on bug only if it came from my Pod-lead because the business logic was complex enough and only we had a fair enough undersntading.
        - on parallel note, i had helped team on git-stragey branching by feature, and some cicd problems.
        - i also had a great help from colleague-3-architect on understadin this portal-infra space and occasional build issues.
    - ### project-4 data-strategy
        - I gave a heads upto my manager and director, though they gave few opitons, they didnt materialize for me.
        - on project-2 cost space, my director asked for a last assignment to come up with a strategy on data for entire cost-space, which was on shared database architecture.
        - the data architecture for entire cost space was overwhelming due to its deep enough business logic hard-wired in storedprocs.
        - bit of reasearch took me to something call defensive strategy which made sense at that time. https://hbr.org/2017/05/whats-your-data-strategy
        - I ruled out offensive, all Ge problem pointed towards defensive strategy.
        - after few brainstorming discussion with team , I proposed few techniques to split the data based on productline, customer etc and to leverae something like cloud-ojbect-store.
