## CXO
- I will consider lucky if I you are looking at my profile
- leaving other Xs, assuming you are CTO, CDO, CIO
- i have only few things to sell you to the best of my current knowledge
- i can store data as cheap as $23 per tb leveraging aws-s3 or eqvt store
- I could think of devising a solution or come with a serveless model with 10gb (10 to 80 million records) with stipulated time of 15min window
- I could help in a scalable-model leveraging partitioning on data with core-domain attributes like product, customer and go further down with sub-domain and crafting with custom-tailored-solution
- Could also help in vertical-ride, evolvable-architecture with good design-options 
- you need to form a team internal, external to solve the problem with out-of-the-box thinking for a novel-business-problem

- [Architect](#architect)
## Architect 
- You could be a solution-architect, system-wide-archiect, data-architect, principal-architect, xyz-architect , accidental(like-me-in-wipro)
- You can expect below from me.
    - my strength is really on applying domain-driven-design, doing trade-off analysis, documenting architectural decisions, design options for novel-business-problems
    - In my view buisness-flow, data-flow diagrams are more important than general clould providers reference architecture. 
    - i generally put the busines-domain-langugae to be centric and ubiquitious, so runtime infra is low preference.
    - I usually draw plain diagrams  which caters larger-stakeholders like (PO, FO, BA,developers) so that we all speak same language and simplify the problem in first-hand. Next explore some new busines-capabilities.
    - i strongly believe core functionality to work smoother, accurate on aggregations, so its important we are clear with core problem.
    - once we are thorough, of course we can  now look a scalability leveraging domain-attributes. 
    - I usually believe in crafting custom-tailored-solution constrained to the actual-problem-space
    - I love taking to all stakeholder from developer to all way from business-stakeholders, I do respect all for their inputs
    - I generally present 2 or 3 design option allow stakeholders to choose interms of cost-constraints like money, developemnt, opportunity etc
    - this might be further helpful

- I am usually bad at below, considerations of mine for you to tradeoff
    - I usually dont have a generic-architecture that I could readily apply, unless the domain-problem is very static in nature.
    - Please excuse me, if I dont have a general cloud-providers infra reference architecture diagram.
    - Also, I am not really good at building brand new CICD pipelines, I usually try some  existing one, figure out alternatives till the feature shapes up well, I usually automate this at end
    - Though, I have some interest in SRE and operational stuff, until business problem demands it, I stay away from over-engineering on SRE the business-attributes should exhibit this behavior
    - if applications are not-internet facing,  I usually  dont emphasize too much metrics like junit, sonar, sast,cast, monitoring(new-relic) tool as they often dont get the context of problem, mostly they have false positives, though configuring them is no harm and potentially serve as a good checklist.

## XYZ Lead
- with all respect, you could be deginated as  team lead, technical lead, POD lead, lead-engineer-developer, principal-engineer ..xyz doing various further roles like system-design, applying architectures , scrum-master, Point-of-Contact, SME
- this might interest you,

## Why do I step into your shoes
- I attempt to know the problem from  your point of view
- some rationale of my  biggest fears you need to know
    - if i/we have misunderstood requirement as whole
    - if there were will be change in requirement which need to be factored
    - do we have wholistic view of problem
    - what are the unknowns i/we need to know
    - if the current tool/technology/solution is optimal enough, cheap enough etc
    - will it bring change in the software design
    - u  are not telling me that new  customer to be added, not sure how long will it take to incorporate
    - not sure if the current tool/applicaiton/feature will be retired/replatformed with new one
-  occasionaly it might appear as if im stepping into your shoes/role, it could be becuase of myrole(could be informal) on an ideology of https://architectelevator.com/ my assignment is usually very short one 6 months. some one has to ride the elevator connecting all stakeholders as gregor mentions, nothing is stopping us to rotate by 90 and imagine left to rides as tram/cable-car which goes from left-to-right or vice versa. this horizontal/cascade ride is very true when we talk on lot of upstream or downstream connected systems/applications

## Business Decision Maker
- You could be PO, FO, executive, director, VP ...xyz 
- Love to talk to you, whats on your mind, how you want me to help
- what data points, you need
- what manual-touch points you want to discuss, automate
- what we can priortize
- what you can expect from me
    - To the best of my knowledge will speak your business-langurage, you dont have to learn our technical-language
    - to listen to your pain points
    - come with a working prototype to POC to have an experience of it
    - give you some options on certain important tradeoffs on  business-flows(immediate-responsiveness,strong-consistency), (performance,scurity)
    - not bother you on operational-stuff like metrics(test-coverage,vulnerabilities,)
- my expectations
    - user personas important ones
    - how the system is used by end-users
    - clarity on core, important business-flows, if down impacts highly
    - to know/hear from you on pain points like usability, lot-of-manual-touchpoints, whic could be addressed in next 6 months or so
    - current manual-touchpoints
    - clarity on unused, lower-adoption of features  
    - what flexibilities you are expecting


## Product Owner
- based on my own experience, POs as oppososed to having a total ownership(procuctdomain,technical,operational-stuff),  play a mix of roles (mgmt,point-of-contact, delegator-to-(technical-team, QA, BA etc) ) 
- most of the times, POs are tasked to own application/tools mostly in capital based, industrial based orgs, so the name could be misleading
- my last company had only 13 product lines, but hundres of POs, so thats where my difference of opinion comes from.
- if you could help me on what you would like to own and your expectations from my side we could have less friction and put our business goal than occasional-namesake-roles
- below is how I could help, clarify
- Fact : mostly I have solved several problems in last 10+ years of 18 year IT career not because of technical(breadth + depth) but puerly undestanding functional-domain-knowledge(mostly breadth, ecosystem, business-flow,data-flow etc )  becuase  I leverage on [domain-driven-design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) 
- optimisitically in my opinion I think a domain-expert-panel(PO,funcitionalowner,BA) should screen the 1st or 2nd round of interview-if-external, if interal-assignment(alteast do a litmus test, unless PO is playing a pure-people-leader-mgmt or forced to do so). atleast you could devise the system problem in a ciphered manner and see if the candiate/new-member(someone like me ) could solve the actual problem, worst-case atleast you get a fair idea on solution cost(development,opportunity,money($,inr,euro )
- ok we have no choice but to work together, here is further, how we can help each other
- whats the core features of the app/system
- what are the top 3 bizness problems you think we should solve for next 6 months or for a year.
- is there any feature in your mind which you think it of greater value that top 3, but you didnt get anyone help from technical-feasability side.
- rather than adding features, you think stabilization is of prime importance.
- no matter what we pick we will together agree and tradeoff something.

- please dont hestiate give feedback, once in a month or so, becuse typically i take projects for 6 months or so.
-  occasionaly it might appear as if im stepping into your shoes/role, it could be becuase of myrole(could be informal) on an ideology of https://architectelevator.com/ my assignment is usually very short one 6 months

## Functional Owner
- not every company has it, but when they have, probably its best consider below
- breadth of functional-domain
- end-user, customers pain-points, re-negotiate on demo-feedback, development-cost
- occasionaly discuss on new buiness capabilities (any one  could also do, but I feet this person is best negoitator along with PO )
- not all features, enhancement are worth, after careful data-points,impact of (1end user vs larger-audience) so push-back with you could help us.
- if you are new like me please involve me in stakeholder discussion, or give me a summmary so that I could help better later
- irrespeciive of my designation, you could treat me as a problem-solver who like brainstorming for new ideas or studid ideas
- any feedback anytime is welcome, please check on my assigment-duration with my reporting mgr, so that u could plan a important delivery.

## Business Analyst
- here's 
- if there's one role i have benefitted in solving many hard problems is on clarity Business Analysts /FOs
- if you know sql, you could pull out the data from database, that's excellent for us to further simplify the requirement
- if you dont have sql knowledge, no problem, we could pull out the data into excel or any spreadsheet which you are comfortable, we could simplify from there, 
- typically we could be undestanding bread and depth of dataflow,
    - if analytics then do aggregation, rollup strategy  on either production-or-near equivalent data proabably masked with cutomer data
    - if data not available, we could brainstorm on the core domain attributes, and ourself project a data volume growth, and validate our few theories
- oh, you have an excellent idea which is benefetial to business ,but so far nobody entertained from technical-team, yes we could discuss, if my role allows i will try to ride up that idea to upper stakeholders to bottom developers

## Backend Developer/Engineer
- hmm irrespective of my designation, i always love coding, designing, evaluating tradeoffs
- I am one of you on git.
- first thing I like is working people smarter than me, so I could be very dumb(domain, familarity)  as your are expert in  the current project, so please expect lot of stupid questions and bare me for few weeks, till I get a good grip on understanding the problem-domain, feature, rationale for current design & tech-stack etc 
- if you are new like me, we are in same boat, we will sail together unless there is a big hole(wrong domain, wrong technology) to sink
- it would be great if could know your availablity, tech-stack, functional-domain-knowledge etc
- Togther we will be heavily collaborating on  git, confluence, though i usually prefer java,sql for complex problems, as long as business requirement is met  with 90% of inteded business-use-cases ask BUC, you could pick your own languge, design, deployment tool
- mostly I dont do  peer code-review, due to lack of  grip on the business-domain, sometime its too obvious.
- please try to summarize the domain,context for which the code change was made, so that we can together see if this code change, breaks any business-flow, data-flow etc.
- however if you request me because for some rationale like you could break the existing business flow, you dont understand the domain, you encountered heavy bugs offlate and you broke somthing u need another pair of eyes. based on the complexity we will set aside some dedicated time and will together approach.
-  if its a scalbility-problem, data-intensive-compuation, major-security-concern I would do a peer review
-  in my view, business-purpose for what we changed the code is most critical thing, so lets document either in code itself, confluence etc
- most importantly we will come up with multiple design-options with cost(development,tradeoffs,timelines, buffer) together we will give present it back and ask decision-maker-of-buisness to choose and we execute according to the plan
    - remember we will try figure out a least-worst-design as opposed to best-design(becuase it keeps changig every year)
    - if there is not much change in business, we dont need heavy design either whatever 1st desing works could be deployed asap, thats the best we could do
    - we could be refactoring (applying martin-flowers techniques) on critical-domain-areas
- just 1 thing if you are too much excited about a technology, we will first try on least-impacted business-domain, test it for few months and then apply slowly in critical-areas.

## Frontend Developer/Engineer
    - Though,I dont have, much grip on frontend technologies, I do care for responsiveness like SLA of overall Page in 2 to 5 seconds, though this varies from domain to domain, will see what I can help, 
    - from backend anything like a dynamic 2d api with headers and attributes is totaly feasible solution to reduce your all developemnt activities
    - generally, I look at reducing number of clicks, elminating some user entry inputs from small controls to whole screen if it makes sense to automate
    - its also worth to know that, we could reduce the network-rountrips, overall input exchange between front-end and backend and together we can stratgize this, historically, we have solved in past by using database and service layer to to the best of knowledge.
    - on a side note we will try to make the layout as adaptive as possible than absloute positioning
